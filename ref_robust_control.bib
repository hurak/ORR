From this polynomial {$\Delta$}({$\lambda$}) a polynomial {$\Delta$}*({$\lambda$}) can be constructed by complex conjugating the coefficients of {$\Delta$}({$\lambda$}) in order to form a polynomial which has real coefficients. When the coefficients are restricted to real coefficients, a simplification is provided that is particularly attractive since the Hurwitz stability of a convex combination of strict Hurwitz nth-degree polynomials requires the testing for the absence of zeros in the real interval (0, 1) of a polynomial of degree (n-1). A similar statement applies to a specialization of the results pertaining to Schur stability when the polynomial coefficients are real. This study, therefore, provides a unified approach for testing the Hurwitz or Schur stability of a convex combination of polynomials and generalizes earlier results to the complex coefficient case}

We support this claim by applying nonsmooth analysis and methods to a challenging "Belgian chocolate" stabilization problem posed in 1994: find a stable, minimum phase, rational controller that stabilizes a specified second-order plant. Although easily stated, this particular problem remained unsolved until 2002, when a solution was found using an eleventh-order controller. Our computational methods find a stabilizing third-order controller without difficulty, suggesting explicit formulas for the controller and for the closed loop system, which has only one pole with multiplicity 5. Furthermore, our analytical techniques prove that this controller is locally optimal in the sense that there is no nearby controller with the same order for which the closed loop system has all its poles further left in the complex plane. Although the focus of the paper is stabilization, once a stabilizing controller is obtained, the same computational techniques can be used to optimize various measures of the closed loop system, including its complex stability radius or Hinfin performance}

  abstract = {Research in robust control theory has been one of the most active areas of mainstream systems theory since the late 70s. This research activity has been at the confluence of dynamical systems theory, functional analysis, matrix analysis, numerical methods, complexity theory, and engineering applications. The discipline has involved interactions between diverse research groups including pure mathematicians, applied mathematicians, computer scientists and engineers. This research effort has produced a rather extensive set of approaches using a wide variety of mathematical techniques, and applications of robust control theory are spreading to areas as diverse as control of fluids, power networks, and the investigation of feddback mechanisms in biology. During the 90's the theory has seen major advances and achieved a new maturity, centered around the notion of convexity. The goal of this book is to give a graduate-level course on robust control theory that emphasizes these new developments, but at the same time conveys the main principles and ubiquitous tools at the heart of the subject. Its pedagogical objectives are to introduce a coherent and unified framework for studying robust control theory, to provide students with the control-theoretic background required to read and contribute to the research literature, and to present the main ideas and demonstrations of the major results of robust control theory. The book will be of value to mathematical researchers and computer scientists wishing to learn about robust control theory, graduate students planning to do research in the area, and engineering practitioners requiring advanced control techniques.},

We also establish the connection between the proposed approach and the finite-step methods based on the resultant theory and the boundary crossing theorem. In a certain sense, the proposed approach provides an efficient numerical implementation of the later two methods and, therefore, by which the robust Hurwitz stability of convex combinations of polynomials can be checked in a definitely finite number of arithmetic operations without having to invoke any root-finding procedure.}

The case with a structured dynamic perturbation is considered. This makes the problem a nontrivial generalization of a classical problem in the theory of dynamical systems. A solution to the robustness problem will be obtained by using a variational system obtained by linearizing the system dynamics along a trajectory, which is uncertain but within the prespecified neighborhood of the nominal trajectory. This gives rise to robustness conditions that can be solved using integral quadratic constraints for linear time periodic systems.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a generic notion of distance between systems that can be used to measure discrepancy between open-loop systems in a feedback sense under several uncertainty structures. When the uncertainty structure is chosen to be four-block (or equivalently, normalized coprime factor) uncertainty, then this generic distance measure reduces to the well-known nu-gap metric. Associated with this generic distance notion, we also define a generic stability margin notion that allows us to give the distance measure a feedback interpretation by deriving generic robust stability and robust performance results. The proposed distance notion and the corresponding results exploit a powerful generalization of the small-gain theorem which handles perturbations in RfrL infin, rather than only in RfrH infin. When the uncertainty structure is fixed to one of the standard structures (e.g., additive, multiplicative, inverse multiplicative, coprime factor, four-block or any mixtures of the above), we give a step-by-step procedure (based on model validation ideas) that shows how the generic notion of distance and the correspondingly generic winding number conditions can be reduced to simple formulae. This work provides a unified framework that captures and embeds previous results in this area and also completes the picture by showing how other results of a similar nature can be obtained from the same framework. The techniques used involve only basic linear algebra, so they also provide a simplification of previous advanced proofs. Furthermore, the various distance measures so created can be used for non-conservative model embedding into the smallest uncertain family. An illustrative example is also given that demonstrates the superior qualities, above the nu-gap metric, of a particular distance measure obtained from this work in situations where the plant is lightly-damped. All systems considered in this paper are linear time-invariant.}

Recent extensions and modifications to MRAC design are included, as are guidelines for combining robust optimal and MRAC controllers. Features of the text include:{$\cdot~~~~~~~~$} case studies that demonstrate the benefits of robust and adaptive control for piloted, autonomous and experimental aerial platforms;{$\cdot~~~~~~~~$} detailed background material for each chapter to motivate theoretical developments;{$\cdot~~~~~~~~$} realistic examples and simulation data illustrating key features of the methods described; and{$\cdot~~~~~~~~$} problem solutions for instructors and MATLAB{\textregistered} code provided electronically.~The theoretical content and practical applications reported address real-life aerospace problems, being based on numerous transitions of control-theoretic results into operational systems and airborne vehicles that are drawn from the authors' extensive professional experience with The Boeing Company. The systems covered are challenging, often open-loop unstable, with uncertainties in their dynamics, and thus requiring both persistently reliable control and the ability to track commands either from a pilot or a guidance computer.Readers are assumed to have a basic understanding of root locus, Bode diagrams, and Nyquist plots, as well as linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, and the use of state-space methods in analysis and modeling of dynamical systems.Robust and Adaptive Control is intended to methodically teach senior undergraduate and graduate students how to construct stable and predictable control algorithms for realistic industrial applications.

This key observation is exploited to show that time-varying compensation does not improve the optimal rejection of disturbances, regardless of the norm used to measure the disturbances. Thus, absolutely summable, finite-energy, or persistent bounded disturbances may be treated in the same manner. It is shown that time-varying compensation does not help in the bounded-input bounded-output robust stabilization of time-invariant plants with unstructured uncertainty.

  abstract = {This paper presents a relatively simple approach, based on chain scattering descriptions, to the synthesis of internally stabilizing controllers which result in a cost function with H{$\infty$} norm strictly less than a prespecified bound. State-space formulae for a generator of all suboptimal controllers are found by solving two coupled J-lossless coprime factorizations of a chain scattering matrix description. A mixed-sensitivity design problem is used to illustrate the solution procedure, and to demonstrate how in certain cases only one algebraic Riccati equation need be solved to get a solution.},

  abstract = {The principal reason for using feedback is to reduce the effect of uncertainties in the description of a system which is to be controlled. H-infinity loop-shaping is emerging as a powerful but straightforward method of designing robust feedback controllers for complex systems. However, in order to use this, or other modern design techniques, it is first necessary to generate an accurate model of the system (thus appearing to remove the reason for needing feedback in the first place). The v-gap metric is an attempt to resolve this paradox - by indicating in what sense a model should be accurate if it is to be useful for feedback design. This book develops in detail the H-infinity loop-shaping design method, the v-gap metric and the relationship between the two, showing how they can be used together for successful feedback design.},

Here we concentrate on the formative years ending in 1985 and leave the subsequent story to be told elsewhere. It is not a comprehensive survey of the literature or even of the most important papers. Rather, it is an attempt to describe events that marked the turning points. The period under scrutiny can be divided into roughly two parts; interest in nonlinear stability dominated the first part and robustness the second}
