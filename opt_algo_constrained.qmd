## Primal methods

- With $m$ equality constraints, they work in the space of dimension $n-m$.
- Three advantages
    - each point generated by the iterative algoritm is feasible â€“ if terminated early, such point is feaible.
    - if they generate a converging sequence, it typically converges at least to a local constrained minimum.
    - it does not rely on a special structure of the problem, it can be even nonconvex.

- but it needs a feasible initial point.
- They may fail for inequality constraints.

They are particularly useful for linear/affine constraints or simple nonlinear constraints (norm balls or ellipsoids).

### Projected gradient method

### Active set methods

### Sequential quadratic programming (SQP)

KKT conditions for a nonlinear program with equality constraints solved by Newton's method.

Interpretation: at each iteration, we solve a quadratic program (QP) with linear constraints.

## Penalty and barrier methods

## Dual methods

## Primal-dual methods
