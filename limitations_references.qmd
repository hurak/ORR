The material here is mostly based on the chapters 5 (SISO systems) and 6 (MIMO systems) of @skogestadMultivariableFeedbackControl2005. 

While the treatment of the book is more than sufficient for our course, we list here some other resources for further reading. The popular paper @steinRespectUnstable2003 provides a nice explanation of the waterbed effect(s). 

Interested readers may want to consult the specialized monograph @seronFundamentalLimitationsFiltering1997, but it is certainly not necessary for our course.

More recent results are surveyed in @chenFundamentalLimitationsIntrinsic2019.
