## Electric vehicle charging

Solve the problem of distributing a limited power to 3 electric vehicle chargers throughout the next 10 hours. Specifically, you are supposed to find an hourly-sampled optimal plan for each car that minimizes the total cost of the charging. 

You are given a time-dependent maximum energy $E_{\mathrm{max}}[k]$ available for charging (in kWh), a time-dependent cost of the energy $c[k]$ (in â‚¬/kWh), maximum allowed charging energy per hour for the *i*th car $E_{i,\mathrm{max}}$ (in kWh), total requested energy $E_{i,\mathrm{req}}$ for the *i*th car (also in kWh), and the departure (discrete) time $d_i$ for each car. 

All the cars are connected to chargers and can start charging from time 1. Departure time is the time when the energy charged to the *i*th car has reached at least $E_{i,\mathrm{req}}$ and charging of the car must stop. 

Let's emphasize: the index $k$ is a time index running from 1 to 10, and the index $i$ specifies the corresponding car, i.e. $i\in\{1,2,3\}$.

The data for this optimization problem is given in the following tables.

| Car | $E_{i,\mathrm{max}}$ (kWh)   | $E_{i,\mathrm{req}}$ (kWh)   | $d_i$   |
|-----|------------------------------|------------------------------|---------|
| 1   | 6                            | 15                           | 3       |
| 2   | 6                            | 25                           | 7       |
| 3   | 4                            | 30                           | 10      |
