  abstract = {Autonomous helicopter flight is widely regarded to be a highly challenging control problem. This paper presents the first successful autonomous completion on a real RC helicopter of the following four aerobatic maneuvers: forward flip and sideways roll at low speed, tail-in funnel, and nose-in funnel. Our experimental results significantly extend the state of the art in autonomous helicopter flight. We used the following approach: First we had a pilot fly the helicopter to help us find a helicopter dynamics model and a reward (cost) function. Then we used a reinforcement learning (optimal control) algorithm to find a controller that is optimized for the resulting model and reward function. More specifically, we used differential dynamic programming (DDP), an extension of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR).}

  abstract = {Efficiently navigating a superpressure balloon in the stratosphere1 requires the integration of a multitude of cues, such as wind speed and solar elevation, and the process is complicated by forecast errors and sparse wind measurements. Coupled with the need to make decisions in real time, these factors rule out the use of conventional control techniques2,3. Here we describe the use of reinforcement learning4,5 to create a high-performing flight controller. Our algorithm uses data augmentation6,7 and a self-correcting design to overcome the key technical challenge of reinforcement learning from imperfect data, which has proved to be a major obstacle to its application to physical systems8. We deployed our controller to station Loon superpressure balloons at multiple locations across the globe, including a 39-day controlled experiment over the Pacific Ocean. Analyses show that the controller outperforms Loon's previous algorithm and is robust to the natural diversity in stratospheric winds. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning is an effective solution to real-world autonomous control problems in which neither conventional methods nor human intervention suffice, offering clues about what may be needed to create artificially intelligent agents that continuously interact with real, dynamic environments.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) and other AI methods are exciting approaches to data-driven control design, but RL's emphasis on maximizing expected performance contrasts with robust control theory (RCT), which puts central emphasis on the impact of model uncertainty and worst case scenarios. This paper argues that these approaches are potentially complementary, roughly analogous to that of a driver and an engineer in, say, formula one racing. Each is indispensable but with radically different roles. If RL takes the driver seat in safety critical applications, RCT may still play a role in plant design, and also in diagnosing and mitigating the effects of performance degradation due to changes or failures in component or environments. While much RCT research emphasizes synthesis of controllers, as does RL, in practice RCT's impact has perhaps already been greater in using hard limits and tradeoffs on robust performance to provide insight into plant design, interpreted broadly as including sensor, actuator, communications, and computer selection and placement in addition to core plant dynamics. More automation may ultimately require more rigor and theory, not less, if our systems are going to be both more efficient and robust. Here we use the simplest possible toy model to illustrate how RCT can potentially augment RL in finding mechanistic explanations when control is not merely hard, but impossible, and issues in making them more compatibly data-driven. Despite the simplicity, questions abound. We also discuss the relevance of these ideas to more realistic challenges.}

  abstract = {This is the 3rd edition of a research monograph providing a synthesis of old research on the foundations of dynamic programming (DP), with the modern theory of approximate DP and new research on semicontractive models. It aims at a unified and economical development of the core theory and algorithms of total cost sequential decision problems, based on the strong connections of the subject with fixed point theory. The analysis focuses on the abstract mapping that underlies DP and defines the mathematical character of the associated problem. The discussion centers on two fundamental properties that this mapping may have: monotonicity and (weighted sup-norm) contraction. It turns out that the nature of the analytical and algorithmic DP theory is determined primarily by the presence or absence of these two properties, and the rest of the problem's structure is largely inconsequential. New research is focused on two areas: 1) The ramifications of these properties in the context of algorithms for approximate DP, and 2) The new class of semicontractive models, exemplified by stochastic shortest path problems, where some but not all policies are contractive. The 3rd edition is very similar to the 2nd edition, except for the addition of a new chapter (Chapter 5), which deals with abstract DP models for sequential minimax problems and zero-sum games, The book is an excellent supplement to several of our books: Neuro-Dynamic Programming (Athena Scientific, 1996), Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control (Athena Scientific, 2017), Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control (Athena Scientific, 2019), and Rollout, Policy Iteration, and Distributed Reinforcement Learning (Athena Scientific, 2020).},

The second volume is oriented towards mathematical analysis and computation, treats infinite horizon problems extensively, and provides a detailed account of approximate large-scale dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. This is a textbook on the far-ranging algorithmic methododogy of Dynamic Programming, which can be used for optimal control, Markovian decision problems, planning and sequential decision making under uncertainty, and discrete/combinatorial optimization. The treatment focuses on basic unifying themes, and conceptual foundations. It illustrates the versatility, power, and generality of the method with many examples and applications from engineering, operations research, and other fields. It also addresses extensively the practical application of the methodology, possibly through the use of approximations, and provides an introduction to the methodology of Neuro-Dynamic Programming, which is the focus of much recent research.},

In particular, among other things, we show that the most common MPC schemes can be viewed as rollout algorithms and are related to policy iteration methods. Furthermore, we embed rollout and MPC within a new unifying suboptimal control framework, based on a concept of restricted or constrained structure policies, which contains these schemes as special cases.},

  abstract = {This book considers large and challenging multistage decision problems, which can be solved in principle by dynamic programming, but their exact solution is computationally intractable. We discuss solution methods that rely on approximations to produce suboptimal policies with adequate performance. These methods are known by several essentially equivalent names: reinforcement learning, approximate dynamic programming, and neuro-dynamic programming. They underlie, among others, the recent impressive successes of self-learning in the context of games such as chess and Go. One of the aims of the book is to explore the common boundary between artificial intelligence and optimal control, and to form a bridge that is accessible by workers with background in either field. Another aim is to organize coherently the broad mosaic of methods that have proved successful in practice while having a solid theoretical and/or logical foundation. This may help researchers and practitioners to find their way through the maze of competing ideas that constitute the current state of the art. The mathematical style of this book is somewhat different than other books by the same author. While we provide a rigorous, albeit short, mathematical account of the theory of finite and infinite horizon dynamic programming, and some fundamental approximation methods, we rely more on intuitive explanations and less on proof-based insights. We also illustrate the methodology with many example algorithms and applications.

  abstract = {This is a monograph at the forefront of research on reinforcement learning, also referred to by other names such as approximate dynamic programming and neuro-dynamic programming. It focuses on the fundamental idea of policy iteration, i.e., start from some policy, and successively generate one or more improved policies. If just one improved policy is generated, this is called rollout, which, based on broad and consistent computational experience, appears to be one of the most versatile and reliable of all reinforcement learning methods. Among others, it can be applied on-line using easily implementable simulation, and it can be used for discrete deterministic combinatorial optimization, as well as for stochastic Markov decision problems. Approximate policy iteration is more ambitious than rollout, but it is a strictly off-line method, and it is generally far more computationally intensive. This motivates the use of parallel and distributed computation. One of the purposes of the monograph is to discuss distributed (possibly asynchronous) methods that relate to rollout and policy iteration, both in the context of an exact and an approximate implementation involving neural networks or other approximation architectures. Several of the ideas that we develop in some depth in this monograph have been central in the implementation of recent high profile successes, such as the AlphaZero program for playing chess, Go, and other games. In addition to the fundamental process of successive policy iteration/improvement, this program includes the use of deep neural networks for representation of both value functions and policies, the extensive use of large scale parallelization, and the simplification of lookahead minimization, through methods involving Monte Carlo tree search and pruning of the lookahead tree. In this monograph, we also focus on policy iteration, value and policy neural network representations, parallel and distributed computation, and lookahead simplification. Thus while there are significant differences, the principal design ideas that form the core of this monograph are shared by the AlphaZero architecture, except that we develop these ideas in a broader and less application-specific framework. Among its special features, the book: a) Presents new research relating to distributed asynchronous computation, partitioned architectures, and multiagent systems, with application to challenging large scale optimization problems, such as combinatorial/discrete optimization, as well as partially observed Markov decision problems. b) Describes variants of rollout and policy iteration for problems with a multiagent structure, which allow a dramatic reduction of the computational requirements for lookahead minimization. c) Establishes a connection of rollout with model predictive control, one of the most prominent control system design methodologies. d) Expands the coverage of some research areas discussed in 2019 textbook Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control by the same author.

We characterize several analytical properties (smoothness, coerciveness, quadratic growth) that are crucial in the analysis of gradient-based algorithms. We then examine three types of well-posed flows for LQR: gradient flow, natural gradient flow and the quasi-Newton flow. The coercive property suggests that these flows admit unique solutions while gradient dominated property indicates that the corresponding Lyapunov functionals decay at an exponential rate; quadratic growth on the other hand guarantees that the trajectories of these flows are exponentially stable in the sense of Lyapunov.}

Various ideas for exploiting the knowledge on the structure and the properties of the optimal value function and the optimal policy in reinforcement learning theory and practice are presented.

A simplified nonlinear Fan Coil Unit (FCU) model is used as an example for which the fan speed control is designed using the off-policy Q-learning algorithm. Additionally, the algorithm properties are discussed, i.e. learning process robustness, Gaussian Process (GP) kernel functions choice. The simulation results are compared to a simple PI design based on a linearized model.},

  abstract = {Energy management is a critical technology in plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles (PHEVs) for maximizing efficiency, fuel economy, and range, as well as reducing pollutant emissions. At the same time, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become an effective and important methodology to formulate model-free and realtime energy-management strategies for HEVs and PHEVs. In this article, we describe the energy-management issues of HEVs/PHEVs and summarize a variety of potential DRL applications for onboard energy management. In addition to the control objective and constraints, an elaborate model of the powertrain components is necessary as part of the solution. For example, the modeling of an engine involves the calculation of the fuel consumption, an estimate of efficiency, and the derivation of the torque and angular speed. Also, a computation of efficiency and an expression of the power balance are required for motor modeling. The transfer process of the speed and power from the motor/generator to the final drive is part of the transmission modeling.}

Each pilot sees the environment from the perspective of their drone by means of video streamed from an onboard camera. Reaching the level of professional pilots with an autonomous drone is challenging because the robot needs to fly at its physical limits while estimating its speed and location in the circuit exclusively from onboard sensors1. Here we introduce Swift, an autonomous system that can race physical vehicles at the level of the human world champions. The system combines deep reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation with data collected in the physical world. Swift competed against three human champions, including the world champions of two international leagues, in real-world head-to-head races. Swift won several races against each of the human champions and demonstrated the fastest recorded race time.

The policy then directly runs on a real Crazyflie 2.1 quadrotor and successfully performs real inclined landings in a flying arena. A single policy evaluation takes approximately 2.5 ms, which makes it suitable for a future embedded implementation on the quadrotor.}

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning algorithms can solve dynamic decision-making and optimal control problems. With continuous-valued state and input variables, reinforcement learning algorithms must rely on function approximators to represent the value function and policy mappings. Commonly used numerical approximators, such as neural networks or basis function expansions, have two main drawbacks: they are black-box models offering little insight into the mappings learned, and they require extensive trial and error tuning of their hyper-parameters. In this paper, we propose a new approach to constructing smooth value functions in the form of analytic expressions by using symbolic regression. We introduce three off-line methods for finding value functions based on a state-transition model: symbolic value iteration, symbolic policy iteration, and a direct solution of the Bellman equation. The methods are illustrated on four nonlinear control problems: velocity control under friction, one-link and two-link pendulum swing-up, and magnetic manipulation. The results show that the value functions yield well-performing policies and are compact, mathematically tractable, and easy to plug into other algorithms. This makes them potentially suitable for further analysis of the closed-loop system. A comparison with an alternative approach using neural networks shows that our method outperforms the neural network-based one.}

This new approach is motivated by the least-squares temporal-difference learning algorithm (LSTD) for prediction problems, which is known for its efficient use of sample experiences compared to pure temporal-difference algorithms. Heretofore, LSTD has not had a straightforward application to control problems mainly because LSTD learns the state value function of a fixed policy which cannot be used for action selection and control without a model of the underlying process. Our new algorithm, least-squares policy iteration (LSPI), learns the state-action value function which allows for action selection without a model and for incremental policy improvement within a policy-iteration framework. LSPI is a model-free, off-policy method which can use efficiently (and reuse in each iteration) sample experiences collected in any manner. By separating the sample collection method, the choice of the linear approximation architecture, and the solution method, LSPI allows for focused attention on the distinct elements that contribute to practical reinforcement learning. LSPI is tested on the simple task of balancing an inverted pendulum and the harder task of balancing and riding a bicycle to a target location. In both cases, LSPI learns to control the pendulum or the bicycle by merely observing a relatively small number of trials where actions are selected randomly. LSPI is also compared against Q-learning (both with and without experience replay) using the same value function architecture. While LSPI achieves good performance fairly consistently on the difficult bicycle task, Q-learning variants were rarely able to balance for more than a small fraction of the time needed to reach the target location.}

The bound is valid for any offline exploration policy that consists of a stabilizing controller and an energy bounded exploratory input. The derivation leverages a relaxation of the minimax estimation problem to Bayesian estimation, and an application of Van Trees' inequality. We show that the bound aligns with system-theoretic intuition. In particular, we demonstrate that the lower bound increases when the optimal control objective value increases. We also show that the lower bound increases when the system is poorly excitable, as characterized by the spectrum of the controllability gramian of the system mapping the noise to the state and the \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{H\}\_{\textbackslash}infty\$ norm of the system mapping the input to the state. We further show that for some classes of systems, the lower bound may be exponential in the state dimension, demonstrating exponential sample complexity for learning the linear-quadratic regulator offline.},

Here, Q-learning is referred to as a family of reinforcement learning methods which find the optimal policy by interaction with an uncertain environment. In the evolution of the algorithm, we first develop an explorized policy iteration (PI) method which is able to deal with known exploration signals. Then, the integral Q-learning algorithm for CT LTI systems is derived based on this PI and the variants of Q-functions derived from the singular perturbation of the control input. The proposed Q-learning scheme evaluates the current value function and the improved control policy at the same time, and are proven stable and convergent to the LQ optimal solution, provided that the initial policy is stabilizing. For the proposed algorithms, practical online implementation methods are investigated in terms of persistency of excitation (PE) and explorations. Finally, simulation results are provided for the better comparison and verification of the performance.},

Adaptive control [1], [2] and optimal control [3] represent different philosophies for designing feedback controllers. Optimal controllers are normally designed of ine by solving Hamilton JacobiBellman (HJB) equations, for example, the Riccati equation, using complete knowledge of the system dynamics. Determining optimal control policies for nonlinear systems requires the offline solution of nonlinear HJB equations, which are often difficult or impossible to solve. By contrast, adaptive controllers learn online to control unknown systems using data measured in real time along the system trajectories. Adaptive controllers are not usually designed to be optimal in the sense of minimizing user-prescribed performance functions. Indirect adaptive controllers use system identification techniques to first identify the system parameters and then use the obtained model to solve optimal design equations [1]. Adaptive controllers may satisfy certain inverse optimality conditions [4].}

  abstract = {It is well known that the extension of Watkins' algorithm to general function approximation settings is challenging: does the projected Bellman equation have a solution? If so, is the solution useful in the sense of generating a good policy? And, if the preceding questions are answered in the affirmative, is the algorithm consistent? These questions are unanswered even in the special case of Q-function approximations that are linear in the parameter. The challenge seems paradoxical, given the long history of convex analytic approaches to dynamic programming. The paper begins with a brief survey of linear programming approaches to optimal control, leading to a particular over parameterization that lends itself to applications in reinforcement learning. The main conclusions are summarized as follows: (i) The new class of convex Q-learning algorithms is introduced based on the convex relaxation of the Bellman equation. Convergence is established under general conditions, including a linear function approximation for the Q-function. (ii) A batch implementation appears similar to the famed DQN algorithm (one engine behind AlphaZero). It is shown that in fact the algorithms are very different: while convex Q-learning solves a convex program that approximates the Bellman equation, theory for DQN is no stronger than for Watkins' algorithm with function approximation: (a) it is shown that both seek solutions to the same fixed point equation, and (b) the ODE approximations for the two algorithms coincide, and little is known about the stability of this ODE. These results are obtained for deterministic nonlinear systems with total cost criterion. Many extensions are proposed, including kernel implementation, and extension to MDP models.},

Two key approaches to this problem are reinforcement learning (RL) and planning. This paper presents a survey of the integration of both fields, better known as model-based reinforcement learning. Model-based RL has two main steps. First, we systematically cover approaches to dynamics model learning, including challenges like dealing with stochasticity, uncertainty, partial observability, and temporal abstraction. Second, we present a systematic categorization of planning-learning integration, including aspects like: where to start planning, what budgets to allocate to planning and real data collection, how to plan, and how to integrate planning in the learning and acting loop. After these two section, we also discuss implicit model-based RL as an end-to-end alternative for model learning and planning, and we cover the potential benefits of model-based RL, like enhanced data efficiency, targeted exploration, and improved stability. The survey also draws connection to several related RL fields, like hierarchical RL and transfer. Altogether, the survey presents a broad conceptual overview of planning-learning combinations for MDP optimization.},

  abstract = {Sequential decision problems, which consist of ``decision, information, decision, information,'' are ubiquitous, spanning virtually every human activity ranging from business applications, health (personal and public health, and medical decision making), energy, the sciences, all fields of engineering, finance, and e-commerce. The diversity of applications attracted the attention of at least 15 distinct fields of research, using eight distinct notational systems which produced a vast array of analytical tools. A byproduct is that powerful tools developed in one community may be unknown to other communities. Reinforcement Learning and Stochastic Optimization offers a single canonical framework that can model any sequential decision problem using five core components: state variables, decision variables, exogenous information variables, transition function, and objective function. This book highlights twelve types of uncertainty that might enter any model and pulls together the diverse set of methods for making decisions, known as policies, into four fundamental classes that span every method suggested in the academic literature or used in practice. Reinforcement Learning and Stochastic Optimization is the first book to provide a balanced treatment of the different methods for modeling and solving sequential decision problems, following the style used by most books on machine learning, optimization, and simulation. The presentation is designed for readers with a course in probability and statistics, and an interest in modeling and applications. Linear programming is occasionally used for specific problem classes. The book is designed for readers who are new to the field, as well as those with some background in optimization under uncertainty. Throughout this book, readers will find references to over 100 different applications, spanning pure learning problems, dynamic resource allocation problems, general state-dependent problems, and hybrid learning/resource allocation problems such as those that arose in the COVID pandemic. There are 370 exercises, organized into seven groups, ranging from review questions, modeling, computation, problem solving, theory, programming exercises and a ``diary problem'' that a reader chooses at the beginning of the book, and which is used as a basis for questions throughout the rest of the book.},

  abstract = {This article surveys reinforcement learning from the perspective of optimization and control, with a focus on continuous control applications. It reviews the general formulation, terminology, and typical experimental implementations of reinforcement learning as well as competing solution paradigms. In order to compare the relative merits of various techniques, it presents a case study of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with unknown dynamics, perhaps the simplest and best-studied problem in optimal control. It also describes how merging techniques from learning theory and control can provide nonasymptotic characterizations of LQR performance and shows that these characterizations tend to match experimental behavior. In turn, when revisiting more complex applications, many of the observed phenomena in LQR persist. In particular, theory and experiment demonstrate the role and importance of models and the cost of generality in reinforcement learning algorithms. The article concludes with a discussion of some of the challenges in designing learning systems that safely and reliably interact with complex and uncertain environments and how tools from reinforcement learning and control might be combined to approach these challenges.}

  abstract = {In recent trends, artificial intelligence (AI) is used for the creation of complex automated control systems. Still, researchers are trying to make a completely autonomous system that resembles human beings. Researchers working in AI think that there is a strong connection present between the learning pattern of human and AI. They have analyzed that machine learning (ML) algorithms can effectively make self-learning systems. ML algorithms are a sub-field of AI in which reinforcement learning (RL) is the only available methodology that resembles the learning mechanism of the human brain. Therefore, RL must take a key role in the creation of autonomous robotic systems. In recent years, RL has been applied on many platforms of the robotic systems like an air-based, under-water, land-based, etc., and got a lot of success in solving complex tasks. In this paper, a brief overview of the application of reinforcement algorithms in robotic science is presented. This survey offered a comprehensive review based on segments as (1) development of RL (2) types of RL algorithm like; Actor-Critic, DeepRL, multi-agent RL and Human-centered algorithm (3) various applications of RL in robotics based on their usage platforms such as land-based, water-based and air-based, (4) RL algorithms/mechanism used in robotic applications. Finally, an open discussion is provided that potentially raises a range of future research directions in robotics. The objective of this survey is to present a guidance point for future research in a more meaningful direction.},

  abstract = {A central question in robotics is how to design a control system for an agile mobile robot. This paper studies this question systematically, focusing on a challenging setting: autonomous drone racing. We show that a neural network controller trained with reinforcement learning (RL) outperformed optimal control (OC) methods in this setting. We then investigated which fundamental factors have contributed to the success of RL or have limited OC. Our study indicates that the fundamental advantage of RL over OC is not that it optimizes its objective better but that it optimizes a better objective. OC decomposes the problem into planning and control with an explicit intermediate representation, such as a trajectory, that serves as an interface. This decomposition limits the range of behaviors that can be expressed by the controller, leading to inferior control performance when facing unmodeled effects. In contrast, RL can directly optimize a task-level objective and can leverage domain randomization to cope with model uncertainty, allowing the discovery of more robust control responses. Our findings allowed us to push an agile drone to its maximum performance, achieving a peak acceleration greater than 12 times the gravitational acceleration and a peak velocity of 108 kilometers per hour. Our policy achieved superhuman control within minutes of training on a standard workstation. This work presents a milestone in agile robotics and sheds light on the role of RL and OC in robot control.}

In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics.Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy.

Different application fields are considered, e.g., guidance, navigation and control systems for spacecraft landing on celestial bodies, constellation orbital control, and maneuver planning in orbit transfers. It is discussed how RL solutions can address the emerging needs of designing spacecraft with highly autonomous on-board capabilities and implementing controllers (i.e., RL agents) robust to system uncertainties and adaptive to changing environments. For each application field, the RL framework core elements (e.g., the reward function, the RL algorithm and the environment model used for the RL agent training) are discussed with the aim of providing some guidelines in the formulation of spacecraft control problems via a RL framework. At the same time, the adoption of RL in real space projects is also analyzed. Different open points are identified and discussed, e.g., the availability of high-fidelity simulators for the RL agent training and the verification of RL-based solutions. This way, recommendations for future work are proposed with the aim of reducing the technological gap between the solutions proposed by the academic community and the needs/requirements of the space industry.}

  abstract = {Building controls are becoming more important and complicated due to the dynamic and stochastic energy demand, on-site intermittent energy supply, as well as energy storage, making it difficult for them to be optimized by conventional control techniques. Reinforcement Learning (RL), as an emerging control technique, has attracted growing research interest and demonstrated its potential to enhance building performance while addressing some limitations of other advanced control techniques, such as model predictive control. This study conducted a comprehensive review of existing studies that applied RL for building controls. It provided a detailed breakdown of the existing RL studies that use a specific variation of each major component of the Reinforcement Learning: algorithm, state, action, reward, and environment. We found RL for building controls is still in the research stage with limited applications (11\%) in real buildings. Three significant barriers prevent the adoption of RL controllers in actual building controls: (1) the training process is time consuming and data demanding, (2) the control security and robustness need to be enhanced, and (3) the generalization capabilities of RL controllers need to be improved using approaches such as transfer learning. Future research may focus on developing RL controllers that could be used in real buildings, addressing current RL challenges, such as accelerating training and enhancing control robustness, as well as developing an open-source testbed and dataset for performance benchmarking of RL controllers.}

  abstract = {Biological and advanced cyber-physical control systems often have limited, sparse, uncertain, and distributed communication and computing in addition to sensing and actuation. Fortunately, the corresponding plants and performance requirements are also sparse and structured, and this must be exploited to make constrained controller design feasible and tractable. We introduce a new ``system level'' (SL) approach involving three complementary SL elements. SL parameterizations (SLPs) provide an alternative to the Youla parameterization of all stabilizing controllers and the responses they achieve, and combine with SL constraints (SLCs) to parameterize the largest known class of constrained stabilizing controllers that admit a convex characterization, generalizing quadratic invariance. SLPs also lead to a generalization of detectability and stabilizability, suggesting the existence of a rich separation structure, that when combined with SLCs is naturally applicable to structurally constrained controllers and systems. We further provide a catalog of useful SLCs, most importantly including sparsity, delay, and locality constraints on both communication and computing internal to the controller, and external system performance. Finally, we formulate SL synthesis problems, which define the broadest known class of constrained optimal control problems that can be solved using convex programming.}

In curling, the environmental characteristics change at every moment, and every throw has an impact on the outcome of the match. Furthermore, there is no time for relearning during a curling match due to the timing rules of the game. Here, we report a curling robot that can achieve human-level performance in the game of curling using an adaptive deep reinforcement learning framework. Our proposed adaptation framework extends standard deep reinforcement learning using temporal features, which learn to compensate for the uncertainties and nonstationarities that are an unavoidable part of curling. Our curling robot, Curly, was able to win three of four official matches against expert human teams [top-ranked women's curling teams and Korea national wheelchair curling team (reserve team)]. These results indicate that the gap between physics-based simulators and the real world can be narrowed.}
