We have already argued that using derivatives within gives us a huge advantage in solving optimization problems. 

There are three ways to compute derivatives:

- symbolic methods,
- numerical finite-difference (FD) methods,
- algorithmic (also automatic) differentiation (AD) methods.

## Symbolic methods

These are essentially the methods that we have all learnt to apply using a pen and paper. A bunch of rules.
