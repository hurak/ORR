The primary tool for us in this part of the course is the [Robust Control Toolbox for Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/robust.html). A nice benefit is that accompanying video tutorials by Brian Douglas [are available](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/series/robust-control.html).

Alternatives in other languages exist, but very often are less well developed and/or documented. A notable exception is [RobustAndOptimalControl.jl](https://juliacontrol.github.io/RobustAndOptimalControl.jl/dev/) for Julia.
