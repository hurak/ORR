  abstract = {This paper chronicles the wide dispersal of Perron's 1907 result on positive matrices into many fields of science. The many proofs given during the last 93 years are categorized and critiqued (including Perron's original two proofs), and a more natural proof is presented. This simple-to-understand result of Perron provides a unequaled vehicle for taking students on a tour of many applied areas with some depth.}

  abstract = {A brand new, fully updated edition of a popular classic on matrix differential calculus with applications in statistics and econometricsThis exhaustive, self-contained book on matrix theory and matrix differential calculus provides a treatment of matrix calculus based on differentials and shows how easy it is to use this theory once you have mastered the technique. Jan Magnus, who, along with the late Heinz Neudecker, pioneered the theory, develops it further in this new edition and provides many examples along the way to support it.Matrix calculus has become an essential tool for quantitative methods in a large number of applications, ranging from social and behavioral sciences to econometrics. It is still relevant and used today in a wide range of subjects such as the biosciences and psychology. Matrix Differential Calculus with Applications in Statistics and Econometrics, Third Edition contains all of the essentials of multivariable calculus with an emphasis on the use of differentials. It starts by presenting a concise, yet thorough overview of matrix algebra, then goes on to develop the theory of differentials. The rest of the text combines the theory and application of matrix differential calculus, providing the practitioner and researcher with both a quick review and a detailed reference.Fulfills the need for an updated and unified treatment of matrix differential calculusContains many new examples and exercises based on questions asked of the author over the yearsCovers new developments in field and features new applicationsWritten by a leading expert and pioneer of the theoryPart of the Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics~Matrix Differential Calculus With Applications in Statistics and Econometrics Third Edition is an ideal text for graduate students and academics studying the subject, as well as for postgraduates and specialists working in biosciences and psychology.},
