Pretty much identical to the [literature recommended in the previous section on optimization theory](opt_theory_references.qmd). 

Some practical aspects are discussed in [Guidelines for Numerical Issues](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/current/refman/guidelines_for_numerical_i.html) for Gurobi Optimizer.
