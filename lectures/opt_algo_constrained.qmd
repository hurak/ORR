We keep adhering to our previous decision to focus on the algorithms that use derivatives. But even then the number of derivative-based algorithms for constrained optimization – considering both equality and inequality constraints – is huge. They can be classified in many ways. Here we choose the very pragmatic point of view of the immediate use within our course, and within the discipline of optimal control in general. It is certainly a bit narrow point of view, but it will get us going... In this viewpoint we admit inspiration by the overview paper @ferreauEmbeddedOptimizationMethods2017. And there is a wealth of literature providing a more rigorous classification, which we give references to.

There are essentially two types of optimization problems (aka mathematical programms) that dominate the discipline of optimal control:

- quadratic programming (QP), 
- nonlinear programming (NLP).

We will therefore focus our discussion of methods to these two. 

## Quadratic programming

We consider the problem 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \operatorname*{minimize}_{\bm x \in \mathbb{R}^n} &\quad \frac{1}{2}\bm{x}^\top\mathbf{Q}\bm{x} + \mathbf{r}^\top\bm{x}\\
 \text{subject to} &\quad \mathbf A \bm x = \mathbf b = \mathbf 0. 
\end{aligned}
$$


### Active set methods



### Interior point methods

### First-order methods

#### Projected gradient method

## Nonlinear programming

### Sequential quadratic programming (SQP)

KKT conditions for a nonlinear program with equality constraints solved by Newton's method.

Interpretation: at each iteration, we solve a quadratic program (QP) with linear constraints.
