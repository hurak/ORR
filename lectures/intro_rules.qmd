## Studying starts before the lecture

In this course we follow, at least partially, the concept of flipped learning. This means that you are expected to study a bit before the lecture. The study material is made available through this web site and consists primarily of texts and frequently also videos. At the lecture we will not repeat the introductory material, instead we will discuss it, and focus on the more advanced topics and examples.

## Learning goals

To guide you in your self-study before the lecture, we always provide a set of learning goals. These are structured into two parts – *knowledge and understading*, and *problem-solving skills*. These are always formulated in a way that guides you while studying. Always start by reading this list and only then proceed to the study material. 

## Online quizzes

In order to push you gently towards such learning before the lecture, you will be asked to fill in a short online quiz (in Brute system) even before the actual lecture. These quizzes will not test if you achieved all the learning goals – you are not certainly not expected to learn everything by yourself – typically only some easier learning goals of the "knowledge and understanding" type.

The **deadlines** are always set to the very beginning of the lectures, that is, **Wednesday, 11:00**.

The role of such quizzes in the overall grading is described below.

## Howework problems

Weekly... binary grading... Through Brute.... In Julia... #TODO

Homework problems are typically related to the "skills" part of the learning goals.

The **deadlines** are always set to **Thursday**, just before the beginning of the corresponding exercises, e.g., **12:45, 14:30, 16:15**.

## Semestral project

Students aiming at the final grading A need to work on one project during the semester (details will be made available shortly after the beginning of the semester). Students with no ambitions for the A grade do not have to work on the projects. 

Although students are encouraged to collaborate, no need to hide it, the project is an individual task. #TODO: this should be more precise. 

At the end of the semester, a few-page technical report is expected. Its grading follows the binary logic –⁠ either it is accepted by the teacher or not. In case the report is not accepted, details will be given and the student can correct/improve/extend the report and resubmit. Note however, that at least one week (5 working days) is needed for the teacher to evaluate the report. A report submitted a few days before the deadline stands no chance to be modified and resubmitted. 

## Grading

### Online quizzes and homework problems 

The primary motivation for introduction of the online quizzes and homework problems is to help your learning process (you receive feedback in "real time'). Your performance in quizzes and homework problems does not affect the final grades. 

However, some thresholds do have to be passed in quizzes and homework problems to earn the credit ("zápočet" in Czech), and to be allowed to take an exam. The bar is not high, but if you are neglecting the quizzes and homework assignments, your passing will be in danger. Namely, **at least 70%** of competences (demonstrated in quizzes and homework problems) must be provably mastered.

### Final exam

The final grade will be based on the exam organized at the end of the semester (in the exam period).  The final exam will have both an open-book and closed-book parts.

### Overall grade

Grading of the two partial exams will be done according to the following standard table, where the percentages refer to the number of maximum points that could be obtained in the given exam.

| Grading | Open-book exam | Closed-book exam |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| A       | 90 %           | 90 %             |
| B       | 80 %           | 80 %             |
| C       | 70 %           | 70 %             |
| D       | 60 %           | 60 %             |
| E       | 50 %           | 50 %             |
| F       | below 50 %     | below 50 %       |

Eventually, in order to set the overall grade (A through F) we just take the minimum of the two grades.

### Role of the semestral project in the grading

While the semestral projects are not mandatory, without them you will not be able to the the highest grade A. On the other hand, if you do the project and your report is accepted, and you pass the exam, the grade you receive in the exam will be improved by one (e.g., from C do B).
