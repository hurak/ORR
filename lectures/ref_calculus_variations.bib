  abstract = {There is an ongoing resurgence of applications in which the calculus of variations has direct relevance. ~Variational Methods with Applications in Science and Engineering reflects the strong connection between calculus of variations and the applications for which variational methods form the fundamental foundation.~ The material is presented in a manner that promotes development of an intuition about the concepts and methods with an emphasis on applications, and the priority of the application chapters is to provide a brief introduction to a variety of physical phenomena and optimization principles from a unified variational point of view. ~The first part of the book provides a modern treatment of the calculus of variations suitable for advanced undergraduate students and graduate students in applied mathematics, physical sciences, and engineering. The second part gives an account of several physical applications from a variational point of view, such as classical mechanics, optics and electromagnetics, modern physics, and fluid mechanics.~ A unique feature of this part of the text is derivation of the ubiquitous Hamilton's principle directly from the first law of thermodynamics, which enforces conservation of total energy, and the subsequent derivation of the governing equations of many discrete and continuous phenomena from Hamilton's principle.~ In this way, the reader will see how the traditional variational treatments of statics and dynamics are unified with the physics of fluids, electromagnetic fields, relativistic mechanics, and quantum mechanics through Hamilton's principle. The third part covers applications of variational methods to optimization and control of discrete and continuous systems, including image and data processing as well as numerical grid generation.~ The application chapters in parts two and three are largely independent of each other so that the instructor or reader can choose a path through the topics that aligns with their interests.},

The reader will learn methods for finding functions that maximize or minimize integrals. The text lays out important necessary and sufficient conditions for extrema in historical order, and it illustrates these conditions with numerous worked-out examples from mechanics, optics, geometry, and other fields. The exposition starts with simple integrals containing a single independent variable, a single dependent variable, and a single derivative, subject to weak variations, but steadily moves on to more advanced topics, including multivariate problems, constrained extrema, homogeneous problems, problems with variable endpoints, broken extremals, strong variations, and sufficiency conditions. Numerous line drawings clarify the mathematics. Each chapter ends with recommended readings that introduce the student to the relevant scientific literature and with exercises that consolidate understanding.},

  abstract = {Lagrange multiplier theory provides a tool for the analysis of a general class of nonlinear variational problems and is the basis for developing efficient and powerful iterative methods for solving these problems. This comprehensive monograph analyzes Lagrange multiplier theory and shows its impact on the development of numerical algorithms for problems posed in a function space setting. The book is motivated by the idea that a full treatment of a variational problem in function spaces would not be complete without a discussion of infinite-dimensional analysis, proper discretization, and the relationship between the two. The authors develop and analyze efficient algorithms for constrained optimization and convex optimization problems based on the augumented Lagrangian concept and cover such topics as sensitivity analysis, convex optimization, second order methods, and shape sensitivity calculus. General theory is applied to challenging problems in optimal control of partial differential equations, image analysis, mechanical contact and friction problems, and American options for the Black---Scholes model.},

The theory and methods are applied to a range of practically important problems, including      optimal control of nonlinear elliptic differential equations,      obstacle problems, and     flow control of instationary Navier--Stokes fluids.  In addition, the author covers adjoint-based derivative computation and the efficient solution of Newton systems by multigrid and preconditioned iterative methods.},
