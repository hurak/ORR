  abstract = {The theory of fundamental design limitations is well understood for the case that the performance variable is measured for feedback. In the present paper, we extend the theory to systems for which the performance variable is not measured. We consider only the special case for which the performance and measured outputs and the control and exogenous inputs are all scalar signals. The results of the paper depend on the control architecture, specifically, on the location of the sensor relative to the performance output, and the actuator relative to the exogenous input. We show that there may exist a tradeoff between disturbance attenuation and stability robustness that is in addition to the tradeoffs that exist when the performance output is measured. We also develop a set of interpolation constraints that must be satisfied by the disturbance response at certain closed right half plane poles and zeros, and translate these constraints into generalizations of the Bode and Poisson sensitivity integrals. In the absence of problematic interpolation constraints we show that there exists a stabilizing control law that achieves arbitrarily small disturbance response. Depending on the system architecture, this control law will either be high gain feedback or a finite gain controller that depends explicitly on the plant model. We illustrate the results of this paper with the problem of active noise control in an acoustic duct.}

We present extensions to both the classical Bode sensitivity integral relation and Poisson integral formula. These extended integral relations exhibit important insights toward trade-offs that must be performed between sensitivity reduction and sensitivity increase due to the aforementioned system characteristics and design constraints. Most importantly, these results display new phenomena concerning design limitations in multivariable systems which have no analog in single-input single-output systems}

This results in a lower bound on the peak of the complementary sensitivity function for unstable plants. The lower bound illustrates the nature of the tradeoff that is imposed, and provides insight into the difficulties imposed on the control of unstable systems. It can be used to quantitatively evaluate tradeoffs between the frequency of the open-loop unstable pole, the peak of the complementary sensitivity functions, and the bandwidth of the closed-loop system. Such a relationship has long been recognized, and is embodied in the classical design rule of thumb which states that the closed-loop bandwidth must be at least twice as large as the frequency of the unstable pole. Results which give insight into this rule and a theoretical basis for it are provided.{$<>$}}

The study extends some well-known properties of ``perfect regulation'' and the ``perfect tracking and disturbance rejection'' of minimum phase systems to non-minimum phase systems. It is shown that perfect rejection to disturbances applied to the plant input can be achieved no matter whether the system is minimum phase or non-minimum phase, whereas a fundamental limitation exists in the achievable transient performance of tracking and rejection to disturbances applied to the plant output for a non-minimum phase system, and that this limitation can be simply and completely characterized by the number and locations of those zeros of the system which lie in the right half of the complex plane. Furthermore, this limitation provides a quantitative measure of the ``degree of difficulty'' which is inherent in the control of such non-minimum phase systems.}

A counterexample shows that when the excess poles/zeros vanishes, the Bode integral drops from infinite to finite value when the open-loop gain crosses a critical value. A revised result is also developed. The salient feature of this approach is that at no stage are either Cauchy's theorem or the Poisson integral invoked; the simplified proof relies only on elementary analysis. This approach carries over to the discrete-time cases in a straightforward manner}
