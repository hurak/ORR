  abstract = {Recent work has shown how to embed differentiable optimization problems (that is, problems whose solutions can be backpropagated through) as layers within deep learning architectures. This method provides a useful inductive bias for certain problems, but existing software for differentiable optimization layers is rigid and difficult to apply to new settings. In this paper, we propose an approach to differentiating through disciplined convex programs, a subclass of convex optimization problems used by domain-specific languages (DSLs) for convex optimization. We introduce disciplined parametrized programming, a subset of disciplined convex programming, and we show that every disciplined parametrized program can be represented as the composition of an affine map from parameters to problem data, a solver, and an affine map from the solver's solution to a solution of the original problem (a new form we refer to as affine-solver-affine form). We then demonstrate how to efficiently differentiate through each of these components, allowing for end-to-end analytical differentiation through the entire convex program. We implement our methodology in version 1.1 of CVXPY, a popular Python-embedded DSL for convex optimization, and additionally implement differentiable layers for disciplined convex programs in PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0. Our implementation significantly lowers the barrier to using convex optimization problems in differentiable programs. We present applications in linear machine learning models and in stochastic control, and we show that our layer is competitive (in execution time) compared to specialized differentiable solvers from past work.},

  abstract = {Equilibrium constrained problems form a special class of mathematical programs where the decision variables satisfy a finite number of constraints together with an equilibrium condition. Optimization problems with a variational inequality constraint, bilevel problems and semi-infinite programs can be seen as particular cases of equilibrium constrained problems. Such models appear in many practical applications. Equilibrium constraint problems can be written in bilevel form with possi- bly a finite number of extra inequality constraints. This opens the way to solve these programs by applying the so-called Karush-Kuhn-Tucker approach. Here the lower level problem of the bilevel program is replaced by the Karush-Kuhn- Tucker condition, leading to a mathematical program with complementarity con- straints (MPCC). Unfortunately, MPCC problems cannot be solved by classical algorithms since they do not satisfy the standard regularity conditions. To solve MPCCs one has tried to conceive appropriate modifications of standard methods. For example sequential quadratic programming, penalty algorithms, regulariza- tion and smoothing approaches. The aim of this thesis is twofold. First, as a basis, MPCC problems will be investigated from a structural and generical viewpoint. We concentrate on a special parametric smoothing approach to solve these programs. The convergence behavior of this method is studied in detail. Although the smoothing approach is widely used, our results on existence of solutions and on the rate of convergence are new. We also derive (for the first time) genericity results for the set of minimizers (generalized critical points) for one-parametric MPCC. In a second part we will consider the MPCC problem obtained by applying the KKT-approach to equilibrium constrained programs and bilevel problems. We will analyze the generic structure of the resulting MPCC programs and adapt the related smoothing method to these particular cases. All corresponding results are new.},

We explore the foundations for such an architecture: we show how techniques from sensitivity analysis, bilevel optimization, and implicit differentiation can be used to exactly differentiate through these layers and with respect to layer parameters; we develop a highly efficient solver for these layers that exploits fast GPU-based batch solves within a primal-dual interior point method, and which provides backpropagation gradients with virtually no additional cost on top of the solve; and we highlight the application of these approaches in several problems. In one notable example, the method is learns to play mini-Sudoku (4x4) given just input and output games, with no a-priori information about the rules of the game; this highlights the ability of OptNet to learn hard constraints better than other neural architectures.},

We prove that, under reasonable sufficient conditions, stationary points of the sum of squares of the constraints are feasible points of the MPEC. In usual formulations of MPEC all the feasible points are nonregular in the sense that they do not satisfy the Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification of nonlinear programming. Therefore, all the feasible points satisfy the classical Fritz-John necessary optimality conditions. In principle, this can cause serious difficulties for nonlinear programming algorithms applied to MPEC. However, we show that most feasible points do not satisfy a recently introduced stronger optimality condition for nonlinear programming. This is the reason why, in general, nonlinear programming algorithms are successful when applied to MPEC.},

The ideal goal is to find a globally optimal solution, and numerical experience indicates that algorithms aiming for Karush--Kuhn--Tucker points often find solutions that are indistinguishable from global optima. In our paper, we provide a theoretical underpinning for this phenomenon, showing that on a broad class of problems the objective can be shown to be an invariant convex function (invex function) of the control decision variables when state variables are eliminated using implicit function theory. In this way, optimality guarantees can be obtained, the exact nature of which depends on the position of the solution within the feasible set. In a numerical example, we show how high-quality solutions are obtained with local search for a river control problem where invexity holds.},

  abstract = {Convex Quadratic programming (QP) has become a core component in the modern engineering toolkit, particularly in robotics, where QP problems are legions, ranging from real-time whole-body controllers to planning and estimation algorithms. Many of those QPs need to be solved at high frequency. Meeting timing requirements requires taking advantage of as many structural properties as possible for the problem at hand. For instance, it is generally crucial to resort to warm-starting to exploit the resemblance of consecutive control iterations. While a large range of off-the-shelf QP solvers is available, only a few are suited to exploit problem structure and warm-starting capacities adequately. In this work, we propose the PROXQP algorithm, a new and efficient QP solver that exploits QP structures by leveraging primal-dual augmented Lagrangian techniques. For convex QPs, PROXQP features a global convergence guarantee to the closest feasible QP, an essential property for safe closedloop control. We illustrate its practical performance on various standard robotic and control experiments, including a real-world closed-loop model predictive control application. While originally tailored for robotics applications, we show that PROXQP also performs at the level of state of the art on generic QP problems, making PROXQP suitable for use as an off-the-shelf solver for regular applications beyond robotics.},

  abstract = {This book emerged from the idea that an optimization training should include three basic components: a strong theoretical and algorithmic foundation, familiarity with various applications, and the ability to apply the theory and algorithms on actual ``real-life'' problems. The book is intended to be the basis of such an extensive training. The mathematical development of the main concepts in nonlinear optimization is done rigorously, where a special effort was made to keep the proofs as simple as possible. The results are presented gradually and accompanied with many illustrative examples. Since the aim is not to give an encyclopedic overview, the focus is on the most useful and important concepts. The theory is complemented by numerous discussions on applications from various scientific fields such as signal processing, economics and localization. Some basic algorithms are also presented and studied to provide some flavor of this important aspect of optimization. Many topics are demonstrated by MATLAB programs, and ideally, the interested reader will find satisfaction in the ability of actually solving problems on his or her own. The book contains several topics that, compared to other classical textbooks, are treated differently. The following are some examples of the less common issues.},

The author's objective is to provide the foundations of theory and algorithms of nonlinear optimization as well as to present a variety of applications from diverse areas of applied sciences. Introduction to Nonlinear Optimization gradually yet rigorously builds connections between theory, algorithms, applications, and actual implementation. The book contains several topics not typically included in optimization books, such as optimality conditions in sparsity constrained optimization, hidden convexity, and total least squares. Readers will discover a wide array of applications such as circle fitting, Chebyshev center, the Fermat--Weber problem, denoising, clustering, total least squares, and orthogonal regression. These applications are studied both theoretically and algorithmically, illustrating concepts such as duality. Python and MATLAB programs are used to show how the theory can be implemented. The extremely popular CVX toolbox (MATLAB) and CVXPY module (Python) are described and used.More than 250 theoretical, algorithmic, and numerical exercises enhance the reader's understanding of the topics. (More than 70 of the exercises provide detailed solutions, and many others are provided with final answers.) The theoretical and algorithmic topics are illustrated by Python and MATLAB examples.},

The algorithm is first-order, and it allows for total asynchrony in the communications and computations of all agents, i.e., all such operations can occur with arbitrary timing and arbitrary (finite) delays. Convergence rates are computed in terms of the communications and computations that agents execute, without specifying when they must occur. These rates apply to convergence to the minimum of each individual objective function, as well as agents' long-run behavior as their objective functions change. Then, to improve the usage of limited communication and computation resources, we optimize the timing of agents' operations relative to changes in their objective functions to minimize total fixed point tracking error over time. Simulation results are presented to illustrate these developments in practice and empirically assess their robustness to uncertainties in agents' update laws.},

  abstract = {Robust optimization is still a relatively new approach to optimization problems affected by uncertainty, but it has already proved so useful in real applications that it is difficult to tackle such problems today without considering this powerful methodology. Written by the principal developers of robust optimization, and describing the main achievements of a decade of research, this is the first book to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date account of the subject. Robust optimization is designed to meet some major challenges associated with uncertainty-affected optimization problems: to operate under lack of full information on the nature of uncertainty; to model the problem in a form that can be solved efficiently; and to provide guarantees about the performance of the solution. The book starts with a relatively simple treatment of uncertain linear programming, proceeding with a deep analysis of the interconnections between the construction of appropriate uncertainty sets and the classical chance constraints (probabilistic) approach. It then develops the robust optimization theory for uncertain conic quadratic and semidefinite optimization problems and dynamic (multistage) problems. The theory is supported by numerous examples and computational illustrations. An essential book for anyone working on optimization and decision making under uncertainty, Robust Optimization also makes an ideal graduate textbook on the subject.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the design and analysis of feedback-based online algorithms to control systems or networked systems based on performance objectives and engineering constraints that may evolve over time. The emerging time-varying convex optimization formalism is leveraged to model optimal operational trajectories of the systems, as well as explicit local and network-level operational constraints. Departing from existing batch and feed-forward optimization approaches, the design of the algorithms capitalizes on an online implementation of primal-dual projected-gradient methods; the gradient steps are, however, suitably modified to accommodate feedback from the system in the form of measurements, hence, the term ``online optimization with feedback.'' By virtue of this approach, the resultant algorithms can cope with model mismatches in the algebraic representation of the system states and outputs, they avoid pervasive measurements of exogenous inputs, and they naturally lend themselves to a distributed implementation. Under suitable assumptions, analytical convergence claims are established in terms of dynamic regret. Furthermore, when the synthesis of the feedback-based online algorithms is based on a regularized Lagrangian function, Q-linear convergence to solutions of the time-varying optimization problem is shown.}

  abstract = {The interplay between optimization and machine learning is one of the most important developments in modern computational science. Optimization formulations and methods are proving to be vital in designing algorithms to extract essential knowledge from huge volumes of data. Machine learning, however, is not simply a consumer of optimization technology but a rapidly evolving field that is itself generating new optimization ideas. This book captures the state of the art of the interaction between optimization and machine learning in a way that is accessible to researchers in both fields.Optimization approaches have enjoyed prominence in machine learning because of their wide applicability and attractive theoretical properties. The increasing complexity, size, and variety of today's machine learning models call for the reassessment of existing assumptions. This book starts the process of reassessment. It describes the resurgence in novel contexts of established frameworks such as first-order methods, stochastic approximations, convex relaxations, interior-point methods, and proximal methods. It also devotes attention to newer themes such as regularized optimization, robust optimization, gradient and subgradient methods, splitting techniques, and second-order methods. Many of these techniques draw inspiration from other fields, including operations research, theoretical computer science, and subfields of optimization. The book will enrich the ongoing cross-fertilization between the machine learning community and these other fields, and within the broader optimization community.},

We show that \$D\_k \$ can be calculated simply on the basis of second derivatives of f so that the resulting Newton-like algorithm has a typically superlinear rate of convergence. With other choices of \$D\_k \$ convergence at a typically linear rate is obtained. The algorithms are almost as simple as their unconstrained counterparts. They are well suited for problems of large dimension such as those arising in optimal control while being competitive with existing methods for low-dimensional problems. The effectiveness of the Newton-like algorithm is demonstrated via computational examples involving as many as 10,000 variables. Extensions to general linearly constrained problems are also provided. These extensions utilize a notion of an active generalized rectangle patterned after the notion of an active manifold used in manifold suboptimization methods. By contrast with these methods, many constraints can be added or subtracted from the binding set at each iteration without the need to solve a quadratic programming problem.}

  abstract = {We propose a method to approximate the solution of online mixed-integer optimization (MIO) problems at very high speed using machine learning. By exploiting the repetitive nature of online optimization, we can greatly speed up the solution time. Our approach encodes the optimal solution into a small amount of information denoted as strategy using the voice of optimization framework. In this way, the core part of the optimization routine becomes a multiclass classification problem that can be solved very quickly. In this work, we extend that framework to real-time and high-speed applications focusing on parametric mixed-integer quadratic optimization. We propose an extremely fast online optimization method consisting of a feedforward neural network evaluation and a linear system solution where the matrix has already been factorized. Therefore, this online approach does not require any solver or iterative algorithm. We show the speed of the proposed method both in terms of total computations required and measured execution time. We estimate the number of floating point operations required to completely recover the optimal solution as a function of the problem dimensions. Compared with state-of-the-art MIO routines, the online running time of our method is very predictable and can be lower than a single matrix factorization time. We benchmark our method against the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi obtaining up to two to three orders of magnitude speedups on examples from fuel cell energy management, sparse portfolio optimization, and motion planning with obstacle avoidance. Summary of Contribution: We propose a technique to approximate the solution of online optimization problems at high speed using machine learning. By exploiting the repetitive nature of online optimization, we learn the mapping between the key problem parameters and an encoding of the optimal solution to greatly speed up the solution time. This allows us to significantly improve the computation time and resources needed to solve online mixed-integer optimization problems. We obtain a simple method with a very low computing time variance, which is crucial in online settings.}

The book is used in the doctoral level course, "Integer and Combinatorial Optimization" at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For solutions to exercises and other instructor resources, please contact Dimitris Bertsimas (dbertsim@mit.edu). The chapters of the book are logically organized in four parts: Part I: Formulations and relaxations includes Chapters 1-5 and discusses how to formulate integer optimization problems, how to enhance the formulations to improve the quality of relaxations, how to obtain ideal formulations, the duality of integer optimization and how to solve the resulting relaxations both practically and theoretically. Part II: Algebra and geometry of integer optimization includes Chapters 6-8 and develops the theory of lattices, oulines ideas from algebraic geometry that have had an impact on integer optimization, and most importantly discusses the geometry of integer optimization, a key feature of the book. These chapters provide the building blocks for developing algorithms. Part III: Algorithms for integer optimization includes Chapters 9-12 and develops cutting plane methods, integral basis methods, enumerative and heuristic methods and approximation algorithms. The key characteristic of our treatment is that our development of the algorithms is naturally based on the algebraic and geometric developments of Part II. Part IV: Extensions of integer optimization includes Chapters 13 and 14, and treats mixed integer optimization and robust discrete optimization. Both areas are practically significant as real world problems have very often both continuous and discrete variables and have elements of uncertainty that need to be addressed in a tractable manner. Distinguishing Characteristics Of This Book:* Develops the theory of integer optimization from a new geometric perspective via integral generating sets; * Emphasizes strong formulations, ways to improve them, integral polyhedra, duality, and relaxations; * Discusses applications of lattices and algebraic geometry to integer optimization, including Grobner bases, optimization over polynomials and counting integer points in polyhedra; * Contains a unified geometric treatment of cutting plane and integral basis methods; * Covers enumerative and heuristic methods, including local search over exponential neighborhoods and simulated annealing; * Presents the major methods to construct approximation algorithms: primal-dual, randomized rounding, semidefinite and enumerative methods; * Provides a unified treatment of mixed integer and robust discrete optimization; * Includes a large number of examples and exercises developed through extensive classroom use.},

We seek "robust" solutions to such programs, that is, solutions which minimize the (worst-case) objective while satisfying the constraints for every possible value of parameters within the given bounds. Assuming the data matrices are rational functions of the perturbation parameters, we show how to formulate sufficient conditions for a robust solution to exist as SDPs. When the perturbation is "full," our conditions are necessary and sufficient. In this case, we provide sufficient conditions which guarantee that the robust solution is unique and continuous (H{\"o}lder-stable) with respect to the unperturbed problem's data. The approach can thus be used to regularize ill-conditioned SDPs. We illustrate our results with examples taken from linear programming, maximum norm minimization, polynomial interpolation, and integer programming.}

  abstract = {Chemical engineering applications have been a source of challenging optimization problems for over 50 years. For many chemical process systems, detailed steady state and dynamic behavior can now be described by a rich set of detailed nonlinear models, and relatively small changes in process design and operation can lead to significant improvements in efficiency, product quality, environmental impact, and profitability.With these characteristics, it is not surprising that systematic optimization strategies have played an important role in chemical engineering practice. In particular, over the past 35 years, nonlinear programming (NLP) has become an indispensable tool for the optimization of chemical processes. These tools are now applied at research and process development stages, in the design stage, and in the online operation of these processes. More recently, the scope of these applications is being extended to cover more challenging, large-scale tasks including process control based on the optimization of nonlinear dynamic models, as well as the incorporation of nonlinear models into strategic planning functions. Moreover, the ability to solve large-scale process optimization models cheaply, even online, is aided by recent breakthroughs in nonlinear programming, including the development of modern barrier methods, deeper understanding of line search and trust region strategies to aid global convergence, efficient exploitation of second derivatives in algorithmic development, and the availability of recently developed and widely used NLP codes, including those for barrier methods [81, 391, 404], sequential quadratic programming (SQP) [161, 159], and reduced gradient methods [119, 245, 285]. Finally, the availability of optimization modeling environments, such as AIMMS, AMPL, and GAMS, as well as the NEOS server, has made the formulation and solution of optimization accessible to a much wider user base. All of these advances have a huge impact in addressing and solving process engineering problems previously thought intractable. In addition to developments in mathematical programming, research in process systems engineering has led to optimization modeling formulations that leverage these algorithmic advances, with specific model structure and characteristics that lead to more efficient solutions. This text attempts to make these recent optimization advances accessible to engineers and practitioners. Optimization texts for engineers usually fall into two categories. First, excellent mathematical programming texts (e.g., [134, 162, 294, 100, 227]) emphasize fundamental properties and numerical analysis, but have few specific examples with relevance to real-world applications, and are less accessible to practitioners. On the other hand, equally good engineering texts (e.g., [122, 305, 332, 53]) emphasize applications with well-known methods and codes, but often without their underlying fundamental properties. While their approach is accessible and quite useful for engineers, these texts do not aid in a deeper understanding of the methods or provide extensions to tackle large-scale problems efficiently.},

  abstract = {We present StochasticPrograms.jl, a user-friendly and powerful open-source framework for stochastic programming written in the Julia language. The framework includes both modeling tools and structure-exploiting optimization algorithms. Stochastic programming models can be efficiently formulated using an expressive syntax, and models can be instantiated, inspected, and analyzed interactively. The framework scales seamlessly to distributed environments. Small instances of a model can be run locally to ensure correctness, whereas larger instances are automatically distributed in a memory-efficient way onto supercomputers or clouds and solved using parallel optimization algorithms. These structure-exploiting solvers are based on variations of the classical L-shaped, progressive-hedging, and quasi-gradient algorithms. We provide a concise mathematical background for the various tools and constructs available in the framework along with code listings exemplifying their usage. Both software innovations related to the implementation of the framework and algorithmic innovations related to the structured solvers are highlighted. We conclude by demonstrating strong scaling properties of the distributed algorithms on numerical benchmarks in a multinode setup. Summary of Contribution: This paper presents StochasticPrograms.jl, an open-source framework for stochastic programming implemented in the Julia programming language. The framework includes an expressive syntax for formulating stochastic programming models as well as versatile analysis tools and parallel optimization algorithms. The framework will prove useful to researchers, educators, and industrial users alike. Researchers will benefit from the readily extensible open-source framework, in which they can formulate complex stochastic models or quickly typeset and test novel optimization algorithms. Educators of stochastic programming will benefit from the clean and expressive syntax. Moreover, the framework supports analysis tools and stochastic programming constructs from classical theory and leading textbooks. We strongly believe that the StochasticPrograms.jl framework can reduce the barrier to entry for incoming practitioners of stochastic programming. Industrial practitioners can make use of StochasticPrograms.jl to rapidly formulate complex models, analyze small instances locally, and then run large-scale instances in production. In doing so, they get distributed capabilities for free without changing the code and access to well-tested state-of-the-art implementations of parallel structure-exploiting solvers. As the framework is open-source, anyone from these target audiences can contribute with new functionality to the framework. In conclusion, by providing both an intuitive interface for new users and an extensive development environment for expert users, StochasticPrograms.jl has strong potential to further the field of stochastic programming.}

This field is currently developing rapidly with contributions from many disciplines including operations research, mathematics, and probability. At the same time, it is now being applied in a wide variety of subjects ranging from agriculture to financial planning and from industrial engineering to computer networks. This textbook provides a first course in stochastic programming suitable for students with a basic knowledge of linear programming, elementary analysis, and probability. The authors aim to present a broad overview of the main themes and methods of the subject. Its prime goal is to help students develop an intuition on how to model uncertainty into mathematical problems, what uncertainty changes bring to the decision process, and what techniques help to manage uncertainty in solving the problems.In this extensively updated new edition there is more material on methods and examples including several new approaches for discrete variables, new results on risk measures in modeling and Monte Carlo sampling methods, a new chapter on relationships to other methods including approximate dynamic programming, robust optimization and online methods.The book is highly illustrated with chapter summaries and many examples and exercises. Students, researchers and practitioners in operations research and the optimization area will find it particularly of interest.

It is mainly dedicated to engineers, chemists, physicists, economists, and general users of constrained optimization for solving real-life problems. Nevertheless, it describes in rigorous mathematical terms the convergence theory that applies to the algorithms analyzed. Users often need to understand with precision the properties of the solutions that a practical algorithm finds and the way in which these properties are reflected in practice. Many theorems concerning the behavior of practical algorithms will be found in this book. The geometrical and computational meaning of each theoretical result will be highlighted to make the relevant theory accessible to practitioners. Often, the assumptions under which we prove that algorithms work will not be the most general ones but will be those whose interpretation helps one to understand the computational behavior in real-life problems. Moreover, the plausibility of most assumptions will be discussed, presenting simple sufficient conditions under which assumptions hold. This helps one foresee what can be expected from a practical algorithm and which properties are not expected at all.},

  abstract = {Least squares is probably the best known method for fitting linear models and by far the most widely used. Surprisingly, the discrete L 1 analogue, least absolute deviations (LAD) seems to have been considered first. Possibly the LAD criterion was forced into the background because of the com\- putational difficulties associated with it. Recently there has been a resurgence of interest in LAD. It was spurred on by work that has resulted in efficient al\- gorithms for obtaining LAD fits. Another stimulus came from robust statistics. LAD estimates resist undue effects from a feyv, large errors. Therefore. in addition to being robust, they also make good starting points for other iterative, robust procedures. The LAD criterion has great utility. LAD fits are optimal for linear regressions where the errors are double exponential. However they also have excellent properties well outside this narrow context. In addition they are useful in other linear situations such as time series and multivariate data analysis. Finally, LAD fitting embodies a set of ideas that is important in linear optimization theory and numerical analysis. viii PREFACE In this monograph we will present a unified treatment of the role of LAD techniques in several domains. Some of the material has appeared in recent journal papers and some of it is new. This presentation is organized in the following way. There are three parts, one for Theory, one for Applicatior.s and one for Algorithms.},

  abstract = {This is a book about optimization on smooth manifolds for readers who are comfortable with linear algebra and multivariable calculus. There are no prerequisites in geometry or optimization. Chapters 3 and 5 in particular can serve as a standalone introduction to differential and Riemannian geometry. They focus on embedded submanifolds of linear spaces, with full proofs. A distinguishing feature is that these early chapters do not involve charts. Chapter 8 provides the general theory so that we can build quotient manifolds in Chapter 9. The optimization algorithms in Chapters 4 and 6 apply to the general case, but can already be understood after reading Chapters 3 and 5. Chapter 7 details examples of submanifolds that come up in practice. Chapter 10 covers more advanced Riemannian tools, and Chapter 11 introduces geodesic convexity. In a one-semester graduate course of the mathematics department at Princeton University in 2019 and 2020 (24 lectures of 80 minutes each, two projects, no exercises), I covered much of Chapters 1--6 and select parts of Chapter 7 before the midterm break, then much of Chapters 8--9 and select parts of Chapters 10--11 after the break. Those chapters were shorter at the time, but it still made for a sustained pace. At EPFL in 2021, I discussed mostly Chapters 1--8 in 13 lectures of 90 minutes, plus as many exercise sessions and two projects. The course is popular with applied mathematicians and mathematically inclined engineering students, at the graduate and advanced undergraduate level. You may also be interested in the Manopt toolboxes (Matlab, Python, Julia), and in the book Optimization Algorithms on Matrix Manifolds by Absil, Mahony and Sepulchre (Princeton University Press, 2008), all freely available online. These slides hold a summary of the basic geometric tools and algorithms from Chapters 3 and 5. Here are a one-hour video and a two-hour video introducing the basics of differential geometry and Riemannian geometry for optimization on smooth manifolds, using a variation of the slides linked here. These two videos have mostly the same contents. This version forms the basis for a forthcoming publication with Cambridge University Press.},

  abstract = {Many problems of recent interest in statistics and machine learning can be posed in the framework of convex optimization. Due to the explosion in size and complexity of modern datasets, it is increasingly important to be able to solve problems with a very large number of features or training examples. As a result, both the decentralized collection or storage of these datasets as well as accompanying distributed solution methods are either necessary or at least highly desirable. In this review, we argue that the alternating direction method of multipliers is well suited to distributed convex optimization, and in particular to large-scale problems arising in statistics, machine learning, and related areas. The method was developed in the 1970s, with roots in the 1950s, and is equivalent or closely related to many other algorithms, such as dual decomposition, the method of multipliers, Douglas--Rachford splitting, Spingarn's method of partial inverses, Dykstra's alternating projections, Bregman iterative algorithms for {$\ell$}1 problems, proximal methods, and others. After briefly surveying the theory and history of the algorithm, we discuss applications to a wide variety of statistical and machine learning problems of recent interest, including the lasso, sparse logistic regression, basis pursuit, covariance selection, support vector machines, and many others. We also discuss general distributed optimization, extensions to the nonconvex setting, and efficient implementation, including some details on distributed MPI and Hadoop MapReduce implementations.},

  abstract = {The basic topic of this book is solving problems from system and control theory using convex optimization. We show that a wide variety of problems arising in system and control theory can be reduced to a handful of standard convex and quasiconvex optimization problems that involve matrix inequalities. For a few special cases there are ``analytic solutions'' to these problems, but our main point is that they can be solved numerically in all cases. These standard problems can be solved in polynomial-time (by, e.g., the ellipsoid algorithm of Shor, Nemirovskii, and Yudin), and so are tractable, at least in a theoretical sense. Recently developed interior-point methods for these standard problems have been found to be extremely efficient in practice. Therefore, we consider the original problems from system and control theory as solved. This book is primarily intended for the researcher in system and control theory, but can also serve as a source of application problems for researchers in convex optimization. Although we believe that the methods described in this book have great practical value, we should warn the reader whose primary interest is applied control engineering. This is a research monograph: We present no specific examples or numerical results, and we make only brief comments about the implications of the results for practical control engineering. To put it in a more positive light, we hope that this book will later be considered as the first book on the topic, not the most readable or accessible. The background required of the reader is knowledge of basic system and control theory and an exposure to optimization. Sontag's book Mathematical Control Theory [Son90] is an excellent survey. Further background material is covered in the texts Linear Systems [Kai80] by Kailath, Nonlinear Systems Analysis [Vid92] by Vidyasagar, Optimal Control: Linear Quadratic Methods [AM90] by Anderson and Moore, and Convex Analysis and Minimization Algorithms I [HUL93] by Hiriart-Urruty and Lemar{\'e}chal. We also highly recommend the book Interior-point Polynomial Algorithms in Convex Programming [NN94] by Nesterov and Nemirovskii as a companion to this book. The reader will soon see that their ideas and methods play a critical role in the basic idea presented in this book.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of minimizing the largest generalized eigenvalue of a pair of symmetric matrices, each of which depends affinely on the decision variables. Although this problem may appear specialized, it is in fact quite general, and includes for example all linear, quadratic, and linear fractional programs. Many problems arising in control theory can be cast in this form. The problem is nondifferentiable but quasiconvex, so methods such as Kelley's cutting-plane algorithm or the ellipsoid algorithm of Shor, Nemirovsky, and Yudin are guaranteed to minimize it. In this paper we describe relevant background material and a simple interior-point method that solves such problems more efficiently. The algorithm is a variation on Huard's method of centers, using a self-concordant barrier for matrix inequalities developed by Nesterov and Nemirovsky. (Nesterov and Nemirovsky have also extended their potential reduction methods to handle the same problem.) Since the problem is quasiconvex but not convex, devising a nonheuristic stopping criterion (i.e., one that guarantees a given accuracy) is more difficult than in the convex case. We describe several nonheuristic stopping criteria that are based on the dual of a related convex problem and a new ellipsoidal approximation that is slightly sharper, in some cases, than a more general result to Nesterov and Nemirovsky. The algorithm is demonstrated on an example: determining the quadratic Lyapunov function that optimizes a decay-rate estimate for a differential inclusion.},

  abstract = {A geometric program (GP) is a type of mathematical optimization problem characterized by objective and constraint functions that have a special form. Recently developed solution methods can solve even large-scale GPs extremely efficiently and reliably; at the same time a number of practical problems, particularly in circuit design, have been found to be equivalent to (or well approximated by) GPs. Putting these two together, we get effective solutions for the practical problems. The basic approach in GP modeling is to attempt to express a practical problem, such as an engineering analysis or design problem, in GP format. In the best case, this formulation is exact; when this is not possible, we settle for an approximate formulation. This tutorial paper collects together in one place the basic background material needed to do GP modeling. We start with the basic definitions and facts, and some methods used to transform problems into GP format. We show how to recognize functions and problems compatible with GP, and how to approximate functions or data in a form compatible with GP (when this is possible). We give some simple and representative examples, and also describe some common extensions of GP, along with methods for solving (or approximately solving) them.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a universal solution to the generalized moment problem, with a nonclassical complexity constraint. We show that this solution can be obtained by minimizing a strictly convex nonlinear functional. This optimization problem is derived in two different ways. We first derive this intrinsically, in a geometric way, by path integration of a one-form which defines the generalized moment problem. It is observed that this one-form is closed and defined on a convex set, and thus exact with, perhaps surprisingly, a strictly convex primitive function. We also derive this convex functional as the dual problem of a problem to maximize a cross entropy functional. In particular, these approaches give a constructive parameterization of all solutions to the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem, with possible higher-order interpolation at certain points in the complex plane, with a degree constraint as well as all solutions to the rational covariance extension problem --- two areas which have been advanced by the work of Hidenori Kimura. Illustrations of these results in system identification and probability are also mentioned.},

A., Minimum {$\ell$}1, {$\ell$}2, and {$\ell\infty$} Norm Approximate Solutions to an Overdetermined System of Linear Equations, Digital Signal Processing12 (2002) 524--560 Many practical problems encountered in digital signal processing and other quantitative oriented disciplines entail finding a best approximate solution to an overdetermined system of linear equations. Invariably, the least squares error approximate solution (i.e., minimum {$\ell$}2 norm) is chosen for this task due primarily to the existence of a convenient closed expression for its determination. It should be noted, however, that in many applications a minimum {$\ell$}1 or {$\ell\infty$} norm approximate solution is preferable. For example, in cases where the data being analyzed contain a few data outliers a minimum {$\ell$}1 approximate solution is preferable since it tends to ignore bad data points. In other applications one may wish to determine an approximate solution whose largest error magnitude is the smallest possible (i.e., a minimum {$\ell\infty$} norm approximate solution). Unfortunately, there do not exist convenient closed form expressions for either the minimum {$\ell$}1 or the minimum {$\ell\infty$} norm approximate solution and one must resort to nonlinear programming methods for their determination. Effective algorithms for determining these two solutions are herein presented (see Cadzow, J. A., Data Analysis and Signal Processing: Theory and Applications).}

  abstract = {This paper develops and analyzes feedback-based online optimization methods to regulate the output of a linear time invariant (LTI) dynamical system to the optimal solution of a time-varying convex optimization problem. The design of the algorithm is based on continuous-time primal-dual dynamics, properly modified to incorporate feedback from the LTI dynamical system, applied to a proximal augmented Lagrangian function. The resultant closed-loop algorithm tracks the solution of the time-varying optimization problem without requiring knowledge of (time varying) disturbances in the dynamical system. The analysis leverages integral quadratic constraints to provide linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions that guarantee global exponential stability and bounded tracking error. Analytical results show that under a sufficient time-scale separation between the dynamics of the LTI dynamical system and the algorithm, the LMI conditions can be always satisfied. This paper further proposes a modified algorithm that can track an approximate solution trajectory of the constrained optimization problem under less restrictive assumptions. As an illustrative example, the proposed algorithms are showcased for power transmission systems, to compress the time scales between secondary and tertiary control, and allow to simultaneously power rebalancing and tracking of the DC optimal power flow points.}

We first use quadratic optimization problems to introduce two key families of methods, momentum and nested optimization schemes, which coincide in the quadratic case to form the Chebyshev method whose complexity is analyzed using Chebyshev polynomials. We discuss momentum methods in detail, starting with the seminal work of Nesterov (1983) and structure convergence proofs using a few master templates, such as that of {\textbackslash}emph\{optimized gradient methods\} which have the key benefit of showing how momentum methods maximize convergence rates. We further cover proximal acceleration techniques, at the heart of the {\textbackslash}emph\{Catalyst\} and {\textbackslash}emph\{Accelerated Hybrid Proximal Extragradient\} frameworks, using similar algorithmic patterns. Common acceleration techniques directly rely on the knowledge of some regularity parameters of the problem at hand, and we conclude by discussing {\textbackslash}emph\{restart\} schemes, a set of simple techniques to reach nearly optimal convergence rates while adapting to unobserved regularity parameters.},

At 12 years of age, the book may be a little young to be a ``classic,'' but since its publication it has been well received in the numerical computation community. We are very glad that it will continue to be available for use in teaching, research, and applications. We set out to write this book in the late 1970s because we felt that the basic techniques for solving small to medium-sized nonlinear equations and unconstrained optimization problems had matured and converged to the point where they would remain relatively stable. Fortunately, the intervening years have confirmed this belief. The material that constitutes most of this book---the discussion of Newton-based methods, globally convergent line search and trust region methods, and secant (quasi-Newton) methods for nonlinear equations, unconstrained optimization, and nonlinear least squares---continues to represent the basis for algorithms and analysis in this field. On the teaching side, a course centered around Chapters 4 to 9 forms a basic, in-depth introduction to the solution of nonlinear equations and unconstrained optimization problems. For researchers or users of optimization software, these chapters give the foundations of methods and software for solving small to medium-sized problems of these types.},

We show under mild assumptions that GGN and SCP have locally linear convergence with the same contraction rate. The convergence or divergence rate can be characterized as the smallest scalar that satisfies two linear matrix inequalities. We further show that bad convergence or divergence at a given local minimum can be a desirable property in the context of estimation problems with symmetric likelihood functions, because it avoids that the algorithm is attracted by statistically undesirable local minima. Both algorithms and their convergence properties are illustrated with a numerical example.}

  abstract = {Solving optimization problems in complex systems often requires the implementation of advanced mathematical techniques. Quadratic programming (QP) is one technique that allows for the optimization of a quadratic function in several variables in the presence of linear constraints. QP problems arise in fields as diverse as electrical engineering, agricultural planning, and optics. Given its broad applicability, a comprehensive understanding of quadratic programming is a valuable resource in nearly every scientific field. Optimal Quadratic Programming Algorithms presents recently developed algorithms for solving large QP problems. The presentation focuses on algorithms which are, in a sense optimal, i.e., they can solve important classes of problems at a cost proportional to the number of unknowns. For each algorithm presented, the book details its classical predecessor, describes its drawbacks, introduces modifications that improve its performance, and demonstrates these improvements through numerical experiments. This self-contained monograph can serve as an introductory text on quadratic programming for graduate students and researchers. Additionally, since the solution of many nonlinear problems can be reduced to the solution of a sequence of QP problems, it can also be used as a convenient introduction to nonlinear programming. The reader is required to have a basic knowledge of calculus in several variables and linear algebra.},

The main results are: (1) It is shown that Lemke's algorithm will solve (or show no solution exists) the problem for M {$\in$} L where L is a class of matrices, which properly includes (i) certain copositive matrices, (ii) certain matrices with nonnegative principal minors, (iii) matrices for bimatrix games. (2) If M {$\in$} L, if the system Ix - My = q, x {$\geq$} 0, y {$\geq$} 0 is feasible and nondegenerate, then the corresponding linear complementarity problem has an odd number of solutions. If M {$\in$} L and q {$>$} 0 then the solution is unique. (3) If for some M and every q {$\geq$} 0 the problem has a unique solution then M {$\in$} L and the problem has a solution for every q. (4) If M has nonnegative principal minors and if the linear complementarity with M and q has a nondegenerate complementary solution then the solution is unique. (5) If yTMy + yTq is bounded below on y {$\geq$} 0 then the linear complementarity problem with M and q has a solution and Lemke's algorithm can be used to find such a solution. If, in addition, the problem is nondegenerate, then it has an odd number of solutions. (6) A procedure based on Lemke's algorithm is developed which either computes stationary points for general quadratic programs or else shows that the program has no optimum. (7) If a quadratic program has an optimum and satisfies a nondegeneracy condition then there are an odd number of stationary points.}

  abstract = {Linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) have emerged recently as a useful tool for solving a number of control problems. The basic idea of the LMI method in control is to interpret a given control problem as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, i.e., an optimization problem with linear objective and positive semidefinite constraints involving symmetric matrices that are affine in the decision variables. The LMI formalism is relevant for many reasons. First, writing a given problem in this form brings an efficient, numerical solution. Also, the approach is particularly suited to problems with ``uncertain'' data and multiple (possibly conflicting) specifications. Finally, this approach seems to be widely applicable, not only in control, but also in other areas where uncertainty arises. Purpose and intended audience Since the early 1990s, with the developement of interior-point methods for solving SDP problems, the LMI approach has witnessed considerable attention in the control area (see the regularity of the invited sessions in the control conferences and workshops). Up to now, two self-contained books related to this subject have appeared. The book Interior Point Polynomial Methods in Convex Programming: Theory and Applications, by Nesterov and Nemirovskii, revolutionarized the field of optimization by showing that a large class of nonlinear convex programming problems (including SDP) can be solved very efficiently. A second book, also published by SIAM in 1994, Linear Matrix Inequalities in System and Control Theory, by Boyd, El Ghaoui, Feron, and Balakrishnan, shows that the advances in convex optimization can be successfully applied to a wide variety of difficult control problems. At this point, a natural question arises: Why another book on LMIs? One aim of this book is to describe, for the researcher in the control area, several important advances made both in algorithms and software and in the important issues in LMI control pertaining to analysis, design, and applications. Another aim is to identify several important issues, both in control and optimization, that need to be addressed in the future. We feel that these challenging issues require an interdisciplinary research effort, which we sought to foster. For example, Chapter 1 uses an optimization formalism, in the hope of encouraging researchers in optimization to look at some of the important ideas in LMI control (e.g., deterministic uncertainty, robustness) and seek nonclassical applications and challenges in the control area. Bridges go both ways, of course: for example, the ``primal-dual'' point of view that is so successful in optimization is also important in control.},

  abstract = {Many practical applications lead to optimization problems that can either be stated as quadratic programming (QP) problems or require the solution of QP problems on a lower algorithmic level. One relatively recent approach to solve QP problems are parametric active-set methods that are based on tracing the solution along a linear homotopy between a QP problem with known solution and the QP problem to be solved. This approach seems to make them particularly suited for applications where a-priori information can be used to speed-up the QP solution or where high solution accuracy is required. In this paper we describe the open-source C++ software package qpOASES, which implements a parametric active-set method in a reliable and efficient way. Numerical tests show that qpOASES can outperform other popular academic and commercial QP solvers on small- to medium-scale convex test examples of the Maros-M{\'e}sz{\'a}ros QP collection. Moreover, various interfaces to third-party software packages make it easy to use, even on embedded computer hardware. Finally, we describe how qpOASES can be used to compute critical points of nonconvex QP problems.},

  abstract = {In this chapter, we lay the foundation for turning our focus from dynamic optimization, which has been the subject of preceding chapters, to the notion of a dynamic game. To fully appreciate the material presented in subsequent chapters, we must in the present chapter review some of the essential features of the theory of finite-dimensional variational inequalities and static noncooperative mathematical games. Today many economists and engineers are exposed to the notion of a game-theoretic equilibrium that we study in this chapter, namely Nash equilibrium. Yet, the relationship of such equilibria to certain nonextremal problems known as fixed-point problems, variational inequalities and nonlinear complementarity problems is not widely understood. It is the fact that, as we shall see, Nash and Nash-like equilibria are related to and frequently equivalent to nonextremal problems that makes the computation and qualitative investigation of such equilibria so tractable. Although the static games discussed in this chapter are really steady states of dynamic games, we are, for the most part, indifferent in this chapter to any underlying dynamics. We also comment that readers familiar with finite-dimensional variational inequalities and static Nash games may wish to skip this chapter.},

In particular, the IPM for optimal control QPs is intended to supersede the HPMPC solver, and it largely improves robustness while keeping the focus on speed.

It seeks to give a representative picture of the research topics most explored in recent years, highlight common themes in the investigations of independent research teams and highlight the contributions of rising as well as established researchers both to the theory of robust optimization and its practice. With respect to the theory of robust optimization, this paper reviews recent results on the cases without and with recourse, i.e., the static and dynamic settings, as well as the connection with stochastic optimization and risk theory, the concept of distributionally robust optimization, and findings in robust nonlinear optimization. With respect to the practice of robust optimization, we consider a broad spectrum of applications, in particular inventory and logistics, finance, revenue management, but also queueing networks, machine learning, energy systems and the public good. Key developments in the period from 2007 to present include: (i) an extensive body of work on robust decision-making under uncertainty with uncertain distributions, i.e., ``robustifying'' stochastic optimization, (ii) a greater connection with decision sciences by linking uncertainty sets to risk theory, (iii) further results on nonlinear optimization and sequential decision-making and (iv) besides more work on established families of examples such as robust inventory and revenue management, the addition to the robust optimization literature of new application areas, especially energy systems and the public good.},

  abstract = {This addition to the ISOR series introduces complementarity models in a straightforward and approachable manner and uses them to carry out an in-depth analysis of energy markets, including formulation issues and solution techniques. In a nutshell, complementarity models generalize: a. optimization problems via their Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions b. on-cooperative games in which each player may be solving a separate but related optimization problem with potentially overall system constraints (e.g., market-clearing conditions) c. conomic and engineering problems that aren't specifically derived from optimization problems (e.g., spatial price equilibria) d. roblems in which both primal and dual variables (prices) appear in the original formulation (e.g., The National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) or its precursor, PIES). As such, complementarity models are a very general and flexible modeling format. A natural question is why concentrate on energy markets for this complementarity approach? s it turns out, energy or other markets that have game theoretic aspects are best modeled by complementarity problems. The reason is that the traditional perfect competition approach no longer applies due to deregulation and restructuring of these markets and thus the corresponding optimization problems may no longer hold. Also, in some instances it is important in the original model formulation to involve both primal variables (e.g., production) as well as dual variables (e.g., market prices) for public and private sector energy planning. Traditional optimization problems can not directly handle this mixing of primal and dual variables but complementarity models can and this makes them all that more effective for decision-makers.},

  abstract = {A substantial interest in aerial robots has grown in recent years. However, the energetic cost of flying is one of the key challenges nowadays. Rotorcrafts are heavier-than-air flying machines that use lift generated by one or several rotors (vertically oriented propellers), and because of this, they spend a large proportion of their available energy to maintain their own weight in the air. In this brief, this concept is used to evaluate the relationship between navigation speed and energy consumption in a miniature quadrotor helicopter, which travels over a desired path. A novel path-following controller is proposed in which the speed of the rotorcraft is a dynamic profile that varies with the geometric requirements of the desired path. The stability of the control law is proved using the Lyapunov theory. The experimental results using a real quadrotor show the good performance of the proposed controller, and the percentages of involved energy are quantified using a model of a lithium polymer battery that was previously identified.}

Here we consider problems with general inequality constraints (linear and nonlinear). We assume that first derivatives are available and that the constraint gradients are sparse. Second derivatives are assumed to be unavailable or too expensive to calculate.  We discuss an SQP algorithm that uses a smooth augmented Lagrangian merit function and makes explicit provision for infeasibility in the original problem and the QP subproblems. The Hessian of the Lagrangian is approximated using a limited-memory quasi-Newton method.  SNOPT is a particular implementation that uses a reduced-Hessian semidefinite QP solver (SQOPT) for the QP subproblems. It is designed for problems with many thousands of constraints and variables but is best suited for problems with a moderate number of degrees of freedom (say, up to 2000). Numerical results are given for most of the CUTEr and COPS test collections (about 1020 examples of all sizes up to 40000 constraints and variables, and up to 20000 degrees of freedom).}

This framework uses a Tikhonov-regularized primal-dual approach in which the agents update the system's primal variables and the cloud updates its dual variables. To minimize coordination requirements placed upon the system, the times of communications and computations among the agents are allowed to be arbitrary, provided they satisfy mild conditions. Communications from the agents to the cloud are likewise carried out without any coordination in their timing. However, we require that the cloud keeps the dual variable's value synchronized across the agents, and a counterexample is provided that demonstrates that this level of synchrony is indeed necessary for convergence. Convergence rate estimates are provided in both the primal and dual spaces, and simulation results are presented that demonstrate the operation and convergence of the proposed algorithm.}

Competitive performance profiles are presented in comparison to state-of-the-art solvers and solution variants in both existing and new benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Mathematical programs with complementarity constraints are notoriously difficult to solve due to their nonconvexity and lack of constraint qualifications in every feasible point. This letter focuses on the subclass of quadratic programs with linear complementarity constraints. A novel approach to solving a penalty reformulation using sequential convex programming and a homotopy on the penalty parameter is introduced. Linearizing the necessarily nonconvex penalty function yields convex quadratic subproblems, which have a constant Hessian matrix throughout all iterates. This allows solution computation with a single KKT matrix factorization. Furthermore, a globalization scheme is introduced in which the underlying merit function is minimized analytically, and guarantee of descent is provided at each iterate. The algorithmic features and possible computational speedups are illustrated in a numerical experiment.}

The book begins by exploring a linear programming problem with random parameters, representing a decision problem under uncertainty. Several models for this problem are presented, including the main ones used in Stochastic Programming: recourse models and chance constraint models. The book not only discusses the theoretical properties of these models and algorithms for solving them, but also explains the intrinsic differences between the models. In the book's closing section, several case studies are presented, helping students apply the theory covered to practical problems. The book is based on lecture notes developed for an Econometrics and Operations Research course for master students at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands - the longest-standing Stochastic Programming course worldwide.},

  abstract = {The increase in kitchen waste (KW) generation and irresponsible rice straw (RS) disposal has accentuated problems regarding environmental pollution and resource wasting. Although anaerobic co-digestion has been shown to be a more efficient strategy for bioenergy production than single digestion, there is still significant resistance to its application and diffusion owing to RS collection and many related factors in practice. Therefore, this study proposes a cooperative scheme for the cross-regional problem involving authorities and disposal plants. Subsequently, a bi-level multi-objective programming is developed to express the complexity of conflicts relationship in a multi-hierarchical problem and to achieve economic development, environmental protection and societal satisfaction in the bioenergy optimization process. A practical case study is then investigated to demonstrate the applicability of methodology in co-digestion deployment and resource recovery improvement, whereby scenario analyses are conducted by adjusting associated parameters. The practical application observed that (1) RS purchase was positively correlated with carbon reduction and social satisfaction targets, while excessive pursuit of social satisfaction resulted in a rebounding of carbon emissions; (2) the most popular mix ratios in disposal plants were 4:1 and 3:1, but they favor the latter when RS is readily available in sufficient quantities. Finally, some targeted suggestions are proposed for all stakeholders, which are expected to be a reference for potential users in other areas. Projected gradient descent has been proved efficient in many optimization and machine learning problems. The weighted {$\ell$}1{$<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\ell<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}1{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$} ball has been shown effective in sparse system identification and features selection. In this paper we propose three new efficient algorithms for projecting any vector of finite length onto the weighted {$\ell$}1{$<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\ell<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}1{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$} ball. The first two algorithms have a linear worst case complexity. The third one has a highly competitive performances in practice but the worst case has a quadratic complexity. These new algorithms are efficient tools for machine learning methods based on projected gradient descent such as compressed sensing, feature selection. We illustrate this effectiveness by adapting an efficient compressed sensing algorithm to weighted projections. We demonstrate the efficiency of our new algorithms on benchmarks using very large vectors. For instance, it requires only 8 ms, on an Intel I7 3rd generation, for projecting vectors of size 107. Federated learning (FL) has been widely used to train machine learning models over massive data in edge computing. However, the existing FL solutions may cause long training time and/or high resource (e.g., bandwidth) cost, and thus cannot be directly applied for resource-constrained edge nodes, such as base stations and access points. In this paper, we propose a novel communication-efficient asynchronous federated learning (CE-AFL) mechanism, in which the parameter server will aggregate the local model updates only from a certain fraction {$\alpha<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\alpha<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}, with 0{$<\alpha<$}1{$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}0{$<$}/mn{$><$}mo linebreak="goodbreak" linebreakstyle="after" is="true"{$>\&$}lt;{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\alpha<$}/mi{$><$}mo linebreak="goodbreak" linebreakstyle="after" is="true"{$>\&$}lt;{$<$}/mo{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}1{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}, of all edge nodes by their arrival order in each epoch. As a case study, we design efficient algorithms to determine the optimal value of {$\alpha<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\alpha<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$} for two cases of CE-AFL, single learning task and multiple learning tasks, under bandwidth constraints. We formally prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm with experiments on Jetson TX2, deep learning workstation and extensive simulations. Both experimental results and simulation results on the classical models and datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism and algorithms. For example, CE-AFL can reduce the training time by about 69\% while achieving similar accuracy, and improve the accuracy of the trained models by about 18\% under resource constraints, compared with the state-of-the-art solutions. In this paper, a new concept of generalized convexity is introduced for (not necessarily) differentiable optimization problem with E{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}E{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-differentiable functions. Namely, for an E{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}E{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-differentiable function, the concept of E{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}E{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-B{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}B{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-invexity is defined. The E{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}E{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-differentiable E{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}E{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-B{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}B{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-invexity notion unify the concepts of convexity, invexity, E{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}E{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-convexity, E{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}E{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-invexity and B{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}B{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-invexity. Further, the sufficiency of the so-called E{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}E{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-Karush-Kuhn--Tucker optimality conditions are established for the considered E{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}E{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-differentiable optimization problem with both inequality and equality constraints under E{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}E{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-B{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}B{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-invexity hypotheses. Moreover, the example of a nonsmooth programming problem with E{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}E{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-differentiable functions is constructed to illustrate the aforesaid results. This paper aims to find a solution of interval uncertainty to multiobjective variational problems. For this, we consider an interval-valued multiobjective variational problem. Then, by using the modified F{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}F{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-objective function method, we construct associated interval-valued multiobjective variational problem with the modified F{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}F{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-objective functions. We establish a relationship between LU{$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}L{$<$}/mi{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}U{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}-pareto optimal solution of original problem and its associated modified problem by using the concept of LU{$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}L{$<$}/mi{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}U{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}-F{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}F{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-convexity and LU{$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}L{$<$}/mi{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}U{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}-F{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}F{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-pseudoconvexity.

  abstract = {Autonomous optimization refers to the design of feedback controllers that steer a physical system to a steady state that solves a predefined, possibly constrained, optimization problem. As such, no exogenous control inputs such as set points or trajectories are required. Instead, these controllers are modeled after optimization algorithms that take the form of dynamical systems. The interconnection of this type of optimization dynamics with a physical system is however not guaranteed to be stable unless both dynamics act on sufficiently different timescales. In this paper, we quantify the required timescale separation and give prescriptions that can be directly used in the design of this type of feedback controllers. Using ideas from singular perturbation analysis, we derive stability bounds for different feedback laws that are based on common continuous-time optimization schemes. In particular, we consider gradient descent and its variations, including projected gradient, and Newton gradient. We further give stability bounds for momentum methods and saddle-point flows. Finally, we discuss how optimization algorithms such as subgradient and accelerated gradient descent, while well-behaved in offline settings, are unsuitable for autonomous optimization due to their general lack of robustness.}

Open-source modeling tools accelerate innovation in equation-based and data-driven applications. Significant resources have been deployed to develop datadriven tools (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn) from tech companies that rely on machine learning services to accelerate business needs. The data and applications of the software are proprietary but the foundational tools are open. Opensource equation-based tools such as Pyomo, CasADi, Gekko, and JuMP are also gaining momentum according to user community and development pace metrics. The future of open-source modeling tools is in specialization and interfaces to other specialized packages. Integration of data-driven (empirical) and equation-based (principles, knowledge-driven) tools is emerging. New compute hardware, productivity software, and training resources have the potential to radically accelerate progress. However, long-term support mechanisms are still needed to sustain momentum and maintenance for key foundational packages.},

This gives some perspective on the scope and limitations of one of the most powerful techniques commonly used in control theory. Also before having much hope of representing engineering problems as LMIs by automatic methods one needs a good idea of which problems can and cannot be represented by LMIs. Little is currently known about such problems. In this article we give a necessary condition, we call "rigid convexity", which must hold for a set \$\{{\textbackslash}cC\} {\textbackslash}in \{{\textbackslash}mathbb R\}{\textasciicircum}m\$ in order for \$\{{\textbackslash}cC\}\$ to have an LMI representation. Rigid convexity is proved to be necessary and sufficient when \$m=2\$. This settles a question formally stated by Pablo Parrilo and Berndt Sturmfels in [PSprep].},

Now [18] hasa dual but clearly defined nature: - an introduction to the basic concepts in convex analysis, - a study of convex minimization problems (with an emphasis on numerical al- rithms), and insists on their mutual interpenetration. It is our feeling that the above basic introduction is much needed in the scientific community. This is the motivation for the present edition, our intention being to create a tool useful to teach convex anal\- ysis. We have thus extracted from [18] its "backbone" devoted to convex analysis, namely ChapsIII-VI and X. Apart from some local improvements, the present text is mostly a copy of the corresponding chapters. The main difference is that we have deleted material deemed too advanced for an introduction, or too closely attached to numerical algorithms. Further, we have included exercises, whose degree of difficulty is suggested by 0, I or 2 stars *. Finally, the index has been considerably enriched. Just as in [18], each chapter is presented as a "lesson", in the sense of our old masters, treating of a given subject in its entirety.},

  abstract = {We present novel mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations for optimization over nonconvex piecewise linear functions. We exploit recent advances in the systematic construction of MIP formulations to derive new formulations for univariate functions using a geometric approach and for bivariate functions using a combinatorial approach. All formulations are strong, small (so-called logarithmic formulations), and have other desirable computational properties. We present extensive experiments in which they exhibit substantial computational performance improvements over existing approaches. To accompany these advanced formulations, we present PiecewiseLinearOpt, an extension of the JuMP modeling language in Julia that implements our models (alongside other formulations from the literature) through a high-level interface, hiding the complexity of the formulations from the end user.}

  abstract = {In this expository article, we study optimization problems specified via linear and relative entropy inequalities. Such relative entropy programs (REPs) are convex optimization problems as the relative entropy function is jointly convex with respect to both its arguments. Prominent families of convex programs such as geometric programs (GPs), second-order cone programs, and entropy maximization problems are special cases of REPs, although REPs are more general than these classes of problems. We provide solutions based on REPs to a range of problems such as permanent maximization, robust optimization formulations of GPs, and hitting-time estimation in dynamical systems. We survey previous approaches to some of these problems and the limitations of those methods, and we highlight the more powerful generalizations afforded by REPs. We conclude with a discussion of quantum analogs of the relative entropy function, including a review of the similarities and distinctions with respect to the classical case. We also describe a stylized application of quantum relative entropy optimization that exploits the joint convexity of the quantum relative entropy function.},

  abstract = {Various distributed optimization methods have been developed for solving problems which have simple local constraint sets and whose objective function is the sum of local cost functions of distributed agents in a network. Motivated by emerging applications in smart grid and distributed sparse regression, this paper studies distributed optimization methods for solving general problems which have a coupled global cost function and have inequality constraints. We consider a network scenario where each agent has no global knowledge and can access only its local mapping and constraint functions. To solve this problem in a distributed manner, we propose a consensus-based distributed primal-dual perturbation (PDP) algorithm. In the algorithm, agents employ the average consensus technique to estimate the global cost and constraint functions via exchanging messages with neighbors, and meanwhile use a local primal-dual perturbed subgradient method to approach a global optimum. The proposed PDP method not only can handle smooth inequality constraints but also non-smooth constraints such as some sparsity promoting constraints arising in sparse optimization. We prove that the proposed PDP algorithm converges to an optimal primal-dual solution of the original problem, under standard problem and network assumptions. Numerical results illustrating the performance of the proposed algorithm for a distributed demand response control problem in smart grid are also presented.},

  abstract = {An accessible treatment of the modeling and solution of integer programming problems, featuring modern applications and software In order to fully comprehend the algorithms associated with integer programming, it is important to understand not only how algorithms work, but also why they work. Applied Integer Programming features a unique emphasis on this point, focusing on problem modeling and solution using commercial software. Taking an application-oriented approach, this book addresses the art and science of mathematical modeling related to the mixed integer programming (MIP) framework and discusses the algorithms and associated practices that enable those models to be solved most efficiently. The book begins with coverage of successful applications, systematic modeling procedures, typical model types, transformation of non-MIP models, combinatorial optimization problem models, and automatic preprocessing to obtain a better formulation. Subsequent chapters present algebraic and geometric basic concepts of linear programming theory and network flows needed for understanding integer programming. Finally, the book concludes with classical and modern solution approaches as well as the key components for building an integrated software system capable of solving large-scale integer programming and combinatorial optimization problems. Throughout the book, the authors demonstrate essential concepts through numerous examples and figures. Each new concept or algorithm is accompanied by a numerical example, and, where applicable, graphics are used to draw together diverse problems or approaches into a unified whole. In addition, features of solution approaches found in today's commercial software are identified throughout the book. Thoroughly classroom-tested, Applied Integer Programming is an excellent book for integer programming courses at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It also serves as a well-organized reference for professionals, software developers, and analysts who work in the fields of applied mathematics, computer science, operations research, management science, and engineering and use integer-programming techniques to model and solve real-world optimization problems.},

We first introduce the PSD lift and the mapping between the PSD lift to the convex hull of the rotation matrices conv SO(3), commonly used in attitude estimation and control, as well as in areas such as computer vision. We next study conditions under which this mapping defines an affine isomorphism. We focus particularly on the set of extreme points of the PSD lift and show that this set is in fact a group; connections with SO(3) and unit quaternions H are also explored. Moreover, the differentiation operation on this group, which is related to the angular velocity of the rigid body, will be discussed. Lastly, we apply the PSD lift in the constrained attitude control problem and approach it via a semidefinite program (SDP). Furthermore, we provide insights into the physical realization and the optimization results through an example.}

This new section-wise piecewise-linear representation can be easily programmed with efficient computer storage. It is a global representation in the sense that a single formula is used to compute for f(x1,x2,...,xn) for all values of (x1, x2,...., xn). Since this representation is expressed in closed analytic form, it allows standard mathematical operations and manipulations to be carried out in theorectical studies, In particular, it led to the possibility of deriving explicit closed form expressions for system parameters and design formulas. Examples are given which illustrate the potential applications of this representation in the modeling and analysis of nonlinear devices, circuits and systems.}

In consequence, the representation proposed uses the minimum number of parameters. The basis functions are obtained recursively by multiple compositions of a unique generating function /spl gamma/, resulting in several types of nested absolute-value functions. It is shown that the representation in a domain in R/sup n/ requires functions up to nesting level n. As a consequence of the choice of the basis functions, an efficient numerical method for the resolution of the parameters of the high-level (HL) canonical representation results. Finally, an application to the approximation of continuous functions is shown.}

By using a Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach, it avoids the limits and oversimplifications that can come with optimization models with one criterion. The book is presented in a concise form, addressing how to solve decision problems in sequences of intelligence, modelling, choice and review phases, often iterated, to identify the most preferred decision variant. The approach taken is human-centric, with the user taking the final decision is a sole and sovereign actor in the decision making process. To ensure generality, no assumption about the Decision Maker preferences or behavior is made. The presentation of these concepts is illustrated by numerous examples, figures, and problems to be solved with the help of downloadable spreadsheets. This electronic companion contains models of problems to be solved built in Excel spreadsheet files. Optimization models are too often oversimplifications of decision problems met in practice. For instance, modeling company performance by an optimization model in which the criterion function is short-term profit to be maximized, does not fully reflect the essence of business management. The company's managing staff is accountable not only for operational decisions, but also for actions which shall result in the company ability to generate a decent profit in the future. This calls for management decisions and actions which ensure short-term profitability, but also maintaining long-term relations with clients, introducing innovative products, financing long-term investments, etc. Each of those additional, though indispensable actions and their effects can be modeled separately, case by case, by an optimization model with a criterion function adequately selected. However, in each case the same set of constraints represents the range of company admissible actions. The aim and the scope of this textbook is to present methodologies and methods enabling modeling of such actions jointly.},

Then, we present a generalization of FSLP based on a tolerance-tube method that addresses the shortcomings of FSLP. The proposed algorithm afSLP consists of two phases. Phase I starts from random infeasible points and iterates towards a relaxation of the feasible set. Once the tolerance-tube around the feasible set is reached, phase II is started and all future iterates are kept within the tolerance-tube. The novel method includes enhancements to the originally proposed tolerance-tube method that are necessary for global convergence. afSLP is shown to outperform FSLP and the state-of-the-art solver IPOPT on a SCARA robot optimization problem.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive introduction to optimization with a focus on practical algorithms for the design of engineering systems.                 This book offers a comprehensive introduction to optimization with a focus on practical algorithms. The book approaches optimization from an engineering perspective, where the objective is to design a system that optimizes a set of metrics subject to constraints. Readers will learn about computational approaches for a range of challenges, including searching high-dimensional spaces, handling problems where there are multiple competing objectives, and accommodating uncertainty in the metrics. Figures, examples, and exercises convey the intuition behind the mathematical approaches. The text provides concrete implementations in the Julia programming language. Topics covered include derivatives and their generalization to multiple dimensions; local descent and first- and second-order methods that inform local descent; stochastic methods, which introduce randomness into the optimization process; linear constrained optimization, when both the objective function and the constraints are linear; surrogate models, probabilistic surrogate models, and using probabilistic surrogate models to guide optimization; optimization under uncertainty; uncertainty propagation; expression optimization; and multidisciplinary design optimization. Appendixes offer an introduction to the Julia language, test functions for evaluating algorithm performance, and mathematical concepts used in the derivation and analysis of the optimization methods discussed in the text. The book can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, statistics, computer science, any engineering field, (including electrical engineering and aerospace engineering), and operations research, and as a reference for professionals.},

  abstract = {Contemporary engineering design is heavily based on computer simulations. Accurate, high-fidelity simulations are used not only for design verification but, even more importantly, to adjust parameters of the system to have it meet given performance requirements. Unfortunately, accurate simulations are often computationally very expensive with evaluation times as long as hours or even days per design, making design automation using conventional methods impractical. These and other problems can be alleviated by the development and employment of so-called surrogates that reliably represent the expensive, simulation-based model of the system or device of interest but they are much more reasonable and analytically tractable.~~This volume features surrogate-based modeling and optimization techniques, and their applications for solving difficult and computationally expensive engineering design problems. It begins by~presenting~the basic concepts and formulations of the surrogate-based modeling and optimization paradigm and then~discusses relevant modeling techniques, optimization algorithms and design procedures, as well as state-of-the-art developments. The chapters are self-contained with basic concepts and formulations along with applications and examples. The book will be useful to~researchers in engineering and mathematics, in particular those who employ computationally heavy simulations in their design work.},

We present these hierarchies of approximations and their main properties: asymptotic/finite convergence, optimality certificate, and extraction of global optimum solutions. We review the mathematical tools underlying these properties, in particular, some sums of squares representation results for positive polynomials, some results about moment matrices (in particular, of Curto and Fialkow), and the algebraic eigenvalue method for solving zero-dimensional systems of polynomial equations. We try whenever possible to provide detailed proofs and background.},

We also outline an automated rewriting system between equivalent formulations of a constraint. MathOptInterface has been implemented in practice, forming the foundation of a recent rewrite of JuMP, an open-source algebraic modeling language in the Julia language. The regularity of the MathOptInterface representation leads naturally to a general file format for mathematical optimization we call MathOptFormat. In addition, the automated rewriting system provides modeling power to users while making it easy to connect new solvers to JuMP.},

This strategy is proposed in order to reduce the number of evaluations of the objective function through dynamic update of canonical Differential Evolution parameters (population size, crossover probability and perturbation rate). The methodology is applied to solve mathematical functions considering test cases from the literature and various engineering systems design, such as cantilevered beam design, biochemical reactor, crystallization process, machine tool spindle design, rotary dryer design, among others.},

One major insight is the connection between the purely analytical character of an optimization problem and the behavior of algorithms used to solve a problem. This was a major theme of the first edition of this book and the fourth edition expands and further illustrates this relationship. As in the earlier editions, the material in this fourth edition is organized into three separate parts. Part I is a self-contained introduction to linear programming. The presentation in this part is fairly conventional, covering the main elements of the underlying theory of linear programming, many of the most effective numerical algorithms, and many of its important special applications. Part II, which is independent of Part I, covers the theory of unconstrained optimization, including both derivations of the appropriate optimality conditions and an introduction to basic algorithms. This part of the book explores the general properties of algorithms and defines various notions of convergence. Part III extends the concepts developed in the second part to constrained optimization problems. Except for a few isolated sections, this part is also independent of Part I. It is possible to go directly into Parts II and III omitting Part I, and, in fact, the book has been used in this way in many universities.New to this edition is a chapter devoted to Conic Linear Programming, a powerful generalization of Linear Programming. Indeed, many conic structures are possible and useful in a variety of applications. It must be recognized, however, that conic linear programming is an advanced topic, requiring special study. Another important topic is an accelerated steepest descent method that exhibits superior convergence properties, and for this reason, has become quite popular. The proof of the convergence property for both standard and accelerated steepest descent methods are presented in Chapter 8. As in previous editions, end-of-chapter exercises appear for all chapters.From the reviews of the Third Edition:``{\dots} this very well-written book is a classic textbook in Optimization. It should be present in the bookcase of each student, researcher, and specialist from the host of disciplines from which practical optimization applications are drawn.''

Error bounds and parametric analysis are the main tools to establish a theory of exact penalisation, a set of MPEC constraint qualifications and the first-order and second-order optimality conditions. The book also describes several iterative algorithms such as a penalty-based interior point algorithm, an implicit programming algorithm and a piecewise sequential quadratic programming algorithm for MPECs.

In this paper, we survey recent approaches for addressing this challenge including (i) approaches for exploiting structure (e.g., sparsity and symmetry) in a problem, (ii) approaches that produce low-rank approximate solutions to semidefinite programs, (iii) more scalable algorithms that rely on augmented Lagrangian techniques and the alternating direction method of multipliers, and (iv) approaches that trade off scalability with conservatism (e.g., by approximating semidefinite programs with linear and second-order cone programs). For each class of approaches we provide a high-level exposition, an entry-point to the corresponding literature, and examples drawn from machine learning, control, or robotics. We also present a list of software packages that implement many of the techniques discussed in the paper. Our hope is that this paper will serve as a gateway to the rich and exciting literature on scalable semidefinite programming for both theorists and practitioners.},

Many problems arising in diverse fields such as machine learning, medicine, chemical engineering, structural design, and airline scheduling can be reduced to a constrained optimization problem. This book provides readers with the fundamentals needed to study and solve such problems. Beginning with a chapter on linear inequalities and theorems of the alternative, basics of convex sets and separation theorems are then derived based on these theorems. This is followed by a chapter on convex functions that includes theorems of the alternative for such functions. These results are used in obtaining the saddlepoint optimality conditions of nonlinear programming without differentiability assumptions. Properties of differentiable convex functions are derived and then used in two key chapters of the book, one on optimality conditions for differentiable nonlinear programs and one on duality in nonlinear programming. Generalizations of convex functions to pseudoconvex and quasiconvex functions are given and then used to obtain generalized optimality conditions and duality results in the presence of nonlinear equality constraints. The book has four useful self-contained appendices on vectors and matrices, topological properties of n-dimensional real space, continuity and minimization, and differentiable functions.},

At every iteration it solves a convex, but generally nonlinear, approximation to the original NLP, exploiting its outer convexities. It is already known that SCP has linear local convergence, though without a tight characterization of the rate. Sequential Convex Quadratic Programming (SCQP) is another "convex-over-nonlinear" substructure exploiting algorithm, for which a tight characterization of the convergence rate has already been obtained. In this paper we show under mild assumptions that in fact both methods have the same local linear convergence - or divergence - rate. We can therefore determine the convergence rate of SCP, which is tightly characterized by two simple matrix inequalities evaluated at the solution. We further reason why - as a heuristic - SCP should in general show more robust global convergence than SCQP. We illustrate this, as well as the local convergence rate, with a numerical example.}

  abstract = {Problems with multiple objectives and criteria are generally known as multiple criteria optimization or multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. So far, these types of problems have typically been modelled and solved by means of linear programming. However, many real-life phenomena are of a nonlinear nature, which is why we need tools for nonlinear programming capable of handling several conflicting or incommensurable objectives. In this case, methods of traditional single objective optimization and linear programming are not enough; we need new ways of thinking, new concepts, and new methods - nonlinear multiobjective optimization.  Nonlinear Multiobjective Optimization provides an extensive, up-to-date, self-contained and consistent survey, review of the literature and of the state of the art on nonlinear (deterministic) multiobjective optimization, its methods, its theory and its background. The amount of literature on multiobjective optimization is immense. The treatment in this book is based on approximately 1500 publications in English printed mainly after the year 1980.  Problems related to real-life applications often contain irregularities and nonsmoothnesses. The treatment of nondifferentiable multiobjective optimization in the literature is rather rare. For this reason, this book contains material about the possibilities, background, theory and methods of nondifferentiable multiobjective optimization as well.  This book is intended for both researchers and students in the areas of (applied) mathematics, engineering, economics, operations research and management science; it is meant for both professionals and practitioners in many different fields of application. The intention has been to provide a consistent summary that may help in selecting an appropriate method for the problem to be solved. It is hoped the extensive bibliography will be of value to researchers.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the mathematical properties of chance constrained programming problems where the restriction is on the joint probability of a multivariate random event. One model that is considered arises when the right-handside constants of the linear constraints are random. Another model treated here occurs when the coefficients of the linear programming variables are described by a multinormal distribution. It is shown that under certain restrictions both situations can be viewed as a deterministic nonlinear programming problem. Since most computational methods for solving nonlinear programming models require the constraints be concave, this paper explores whether the resultant problem meets the concavity assumption. For many probability laws of practical importance, the constraint in the first type of model is shown to violate concavity. However, a simple logarithmic transformation does produce a concave restriction for an important class of problems. The paper also surveys the ``generalized linear programming'' method for solving such problems when the logarithmic transformation is justified. For the second type model, the constraint is demonstrated to be nonconcave.}

As a variation on this problem, if the total energy consumption between two boundary states is fixed, minimum-time and/or minimum-control-effort trajectories are computed for the aerial vehicle.

The coordinator performs the subgradient iteration incrementally and asynchronously, by taking steps along the subgradients of the component funtions that are available at the update time. The incremental approach has performed very well in centralized computation, and the parallel implementation should improve its performance substantially, particularly for typical problems where computation of the component subgradients is relatively costly.},

The classical optimization methodology works under the premise that all problem data are available to a central entity (a computing agent or node). However, this premise does not apply to large networked systems, where each agent (node) in the network typically has access only to its private local information and has only a local view of the network structure. This review surveys the development of such distributed computational models for time-varying networks. To emphasize the role of the network structure in these approaches, we focus on a simple direct primal (sub)gradient method, but we also provide an overview of other distributed methods for optimization in networks. Applications of the distributed optimization framework to the control of power systems, least squares solutions to linear equations, and model predictive control are also presented.}

This problem may happen to be computationally intractable; our goal is to build its computationally tractable approximation, i.e., an efficiently solvable deterministic optimization program with the feasible set contained in the chance constrained problem. We construct a general class of such convex conservative approximations of the corresponding chance constrained problem. Moreover, under the assumptions that the constraints are affine in the perturbations and the entries in the perturbation vector are independent-of-each-other random variables, we build a large deviation-type approximation, referred to as ``Bernstein approximation,'' of the chance constrained problem. This approximation is convex and efficiently solvable. We propose a simulation-based scheme for bounding the optimal value in the chance constrained problem and report numerical experiments aimed at comparing the Bernstein and well-known scenario approximation approaches. Finally, we extend our construction to the case of ambiguous chance constrained problems, where the random perturbations are independent with the collection of distributions known to belong to a given convex compact set rather than to be known exactly, while the chance constraint should be satisfied for every distribution given by this set.}

  abstract = {It was in the middle of the 1980s, when the seminal paper by Kar\- markar opened a new epoch in nonlinear optimization. The importance of this paper, containing a new polynomial-time algorithm for linear op\- timization problems, was not only in its complexity bound. At that time, the most surprising feature of this algorithm was that the theoretical pre\- diction of its high efficiency was supported by excellent computational results. This unusual fact dramatically changed the style and direc\- tions of the research in nonlinear optimization. Thereafter it became more and more common that the new methods were provided with a complexity analysis, which was considered a better justification of their efficiency than computational experiments. In a new rapidly develop\- ing field, which got the name "polynomial-time interior-point methods", such a justification was obligatory. Afteralmost fifteen years of intensive research, the main results of this development started to appear in monographs [12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Approximately at that time the author was asked to prepare a new course on nonlinear optimization for graduate students. The idea was to create a course which would reflect the new developments in the field. Actually, this was a major challenge. At the time only the theory of interior-point methods for linear optimization was polished enough to be explained to students. The general theory of self-concordant functions had appeared in print only once in the form of research monograph [12].},

It contains a unified and rigorous presentation of the acceleration techniques for minimization schemes of first- and second-order. It provides readers with a full treatment of the smoothing technique, which has tremendously extended the abilities of gradient-type methods. Several powerful approaches in structural optimization, including optimization in relative scale and polynomial-time interior-point methods, are also discussed in detail. Researchers in theoretical optimization as well as professionals working on optimization problems will findthis book very useful. It presents many successful examples of how to develop very fast specialized minimization algorithms. Based on the author's lectures, it can naturally serve as the basis for introductory and advanced courses in convex optimization for students in engineering, economics, computer science and mathematics.},

  abstract = {We introduce a first-order method for solving very large convex cone programs. The method uses an operator splitting method, the alternating directions method of multipliers, to solve the homogeneous self-dual embedding, an equivalent feasibility problem involving finding a nonzero point in the intersection of a subspace and a cone. This approach has several favorable properties. Compared to interior-point methods, first-order methods scale to very large problems, at the cost of requiring more time to reach very high accuracy. Compared to other first-order methods for cone programs, our approach finds both primal and dual solutions when available or a certificate of infeasibility or unboundedness otherwise, is parameter free, and the per-iteration cost of the method is the same as applying a splitting method to the primal or dual alone. We discuss efficient implementation of the method in detail, including direct and indirect methods for computing projection onto the subspace, scaling the original problem data, and stopping criteria. We describe an open-source implementation, which handles the usual (symmetric) nonnegative, second-order, and semidefinite cones as well as the (non-self-dual) exponential and power cones and their duals. We report numerical results that show speedups over interior-point cone solvers for large problems, and scaling to very large general cone programs.},

Specifically, we show that the self-dual homogeneous model returns facial reduction certificates when it fails to return a primal-dual optimal solution or a certificate of infeasibility. Using this observation, we give an algorithm based on facial reduction for solving the primal problem that, in principle, always succeeds. (An analogous algorithm is easily stated for the dual problem.) This algorithm has the appealing property that it only performs facial reduction when it is required, not when it is possible; e.g., if a primal-dual optimal solution exists, it will be found in lieu of a facial reduction certificate even if Slater's condition fails. For the case of linear, second-order, and semidefinite optimization, we show that the algorithm can be implemented by assuming oracle access to the central-path limit point of an extended embedding, a strictly feasible conic problem with a strictly feasible dual. We then give numerical experiments illustrating barriers to practical implementation.}

  abstract = {We consider optimization problems with equality, inequality, and abstract set constraints. We investigate the relations between various characteristics of the constraint set related to the existence of Lagrange multipliers. For problems with no abstract set constraint, the classical condition of quasiregularity provides the connecting link between the most common constraint qualifications and existence of Lagrange multipliers. In earlier work, we introduced a new and general condition, pseudonormality, that is central within the theory of constraint qualifications, exact penalty functions, and existence of Lagrange multipliers. In this paper, we explore the relations between pseudonormality, quasiregularity, and existence of Lagrange multipliers, and show that, unlike pseudonormality, quasiregularity cannot play the role of a general constraint qualification in the presence of an abstract set constraint. In particular, under a regularity assumption on the abstract constraint set, we show that pseudonormality implies quasiregularity. However, contrary to pseudonormality, quasiregularity does not imply the existence of Lagrange multipliers, except under additional assumptions.}

Motivated by the need for a robust embedded QP solver in robotic applications, qpSWIFT employs standard primal-dual interior-point method, along with Mehrotra predictor--corrector steps and Nesterov--Todd scaling. The sparse structure of the resulting Karush--Kuhn--Tucker linear system in the QP formulation is exploited, and sparse direct methods are utilized to solve the linear system of equations. To further accelerate the factorization process, we only modify the corresponding rows of the matrix factors that change during iterations and cache the nonzero Cholesky pattern. qpSWIFT is library free, written in ANSI-C and its performance is benchmarked through standard problems that could be cast as QP. Numerical results show that qpSWIFT outperforms state-of-the-art solvers for small scale problems. To evaluate the performance of the solver, a real-time implementation of the solver in the model predictive control framework through experiments on a quadrupedal robot are presented.}

The DVI provides a powerful modeling paradigm for many applied problems in which dynamics, inequalities, and discontinuities are present; examples of such problems include constrained time-dependent physical systems with unilateral constraints, differential Nash games, and hybrid engineering systems with variable structures. The DVI unifies several mathematical problem classes that include ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with smooth and discontinuous right-hand sides, differential algebraic equations (DAEs), dynamic complementarity systems, and evolutionary variational inequalities. Conditions are presented under which the DVI can be converted, either locally or globally, to an equivalent ODE with a Lipschitz continuous right-hand function. For DVIs that cannot be so converted, we consider their numerical resolution via an Euler time-stepping procedure, which involves the solution of a sequence of finite-dimensional variational inequalities. Borrowing results from differential inclusions (DIs) with upper semicontinuous, closed and convex valued multifunctions, we establish the convergence of such a procedure for solving initial-value DVIs. We also present a class of DVIs for which the theory of DIs is not directly applicable, and yet similar convergence can be established. Finally, we extend the method to a boundary-value DVI and provide conditions for the convergence of the method. The results in this paper pertain exclusively to systems with ``index'' not exceeding two and which have absolutely continuous solutions.},

The approach optimizes directly over the sum-of-squares cone and its dual, circumventing the semidefinite programming (SDP) reformulation, which requires a large number of auxiliary variables when the degree of sum-of-squares polynomials is large. As a result, it has substantially lower theoretical time and space complexity than the conventional SDP-based approach as the degree increases. Although our approach avoids the SDP reformulation, an optimal solution to the semidefinite program can be recovered with little additional effort. Computational results confirm that the proposed method is several orders of magnitude faster than the SDP-based approach for optimization problems over high-degree sum-of-squares polynomials.}

Much like Newton's method is a standard tool for solving unconstrained smooth optimization problems of modest size, proximal algorithms can be viewed as an analogous tool for nonsmooth, constrained, large-scale, or distributed versions of these problems. They are very generally applicable, but are especially well-suited to problems of substantial recent interest involving large or high-dimensional datasets. Proximal methods sit at a higher level of abstraction than classical algorithms like Newton's method: the base operation is evaluating the proximal operator of a function, which itself involves solving a small convex optimization problem. These subproblems, which generalize the problem of projecting a point onto a convex set, often admit closed-form solutions or can be solved very quickly with standard or simple specialized methods. Here, we discuss the many different interpretations of proximal operators and algorithms, describe their connections to many other topics in optimization and applied mathematics, survey some popular algorithms, and provide a large number of examples of proximal operators that commonly arise in practice.}

The basic idea of this widely used method came from control theory but it has important consequences in quadratic and semidefinite optimization, convex geometry, and linear algebra as well. These were all active research areas, but as there was little interaction between researchers in these different areas, their results remained mainly isolated. Here we give a unified analysis of the theory by providing three different proofs for the S-lemma and revealing hidden connections with various areas of mathematics. We prove some new duality results and present applications from control theory, error estimation, and computational geometry.}

  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are capable of collecting an enormous amount of data over space and time. Often, the ultimate objective is to derive an estimate of a parameter or function from these data. This paper investigates a general class of distributed algorithms for "in-network" data processing, eliminating the need to transmit raw data to a central point. This can provide significant reductions in the amount of communication and energy required to obtain an accurate estimate. The estimation problems we consider are expressed as the optimization of a cost function involving data from all sensor nodes. The distributed algorithms are based on an incremental optimization process. A parameter estimate is circulated through the network, and along the way each node makes a small adjustment to the estimate based on its local data. Applying results from the theory of incremental subgradient optimization, we show that for a broad class of estimation problems the distributed algorithms converge to within an e-ball around the globally optimal value. Furthermore, bounds on the number incremental steps required for a particular level of accuracy provide insight into the trade-off between estimation performance and communication overhead. In many realistic scenarios, the distributed algorithms are much more efficient, in terms of energy and communications, than centralized estimation schemes. The theory is verified through simulated applications in robust estimation, source localization, cluster analysis and density estimation.},

In this paper we propose a novel method of solving MPECs by appropriate reformulation of the equilibrium conditions. The reformulation can be easily incorporated in a certain class of interior point algorithms for nonlinear optimization. The algorithm used in the study follows a primal-dual interior point approach and shows encouraging results on a test suite of MPECs. The algorithm is also able to perform optimization of distillation columns with phase changes and tray optimization using only continuous variables. We also consider a number of topics to improve performance of the algorithm and to identify classes of process engineering problems that can be handled as MPECs.},

  abstract = {Mathematical programs with equilibrium (or complementarity) constraints, MPECs for short, are a dif- ficult class of constrained optimization problems. The feasible set has a very special structure and violates most of the standard constraint qualifications (CQs). Thus, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are not necessarily satisfied by minimizers and the convergence assumptions of many methods for solving constrained optimization problems are not fulfilled. Therefore it is necessary, both from a theoretical and numerical point of view, to consider suitable optimality conditions, tailored CQs and specially designed al- gorithms for solving MPECs. In this paper, we present a new sequential optimality condition useful for the convergence analysis for several methods of solving MPECs, such as relaxations schemes, complementarity- penalty methods and interior-relaxation methods. We also introduce a variant of the augmented Lagrangian method for solving MPEC whose stopping criterion is based on this sequential condition and it has strong convergence properties. Furthermore, a new CQ for M-stationary which is weaker than the recently intro- duced MPEC relaxed constant positive linear dependence (MPEC-RCPLD) associated to such sequential condition is presented. Relations between the old and new CQs as well as the algorithmic consequences will be discussed.}

  abstract = {Piecewise linear (PWL) functions are used in a variety of applications. Computing such continuous PWL functions, however, is a challenging task. Software packages and the literature on PWL function fitting are dominated by heuristic methods. This is true for both fitting discrete data points and continuous univariate functions. The only exact methods rely on nonconvex model formulations. Exact methods compute continuous PWL function for a fixed number of breakpoints minimizing some distance function between the original function and the PWL function. An optimal PWL function can only be computed if the breakpoints are allowed to be placed freely and are not fixed to a set of candidate breakpoints. In this paper, we propose the first convex model for optimal continuous univariate PWL function fitting. Dependent on the metrics chosen, the resulting formulations are either mixed-integer linear programming or mixed-integer quadratic programming problems. These models yield optimal continuous PWL functions for a set of discrete data. On the basis of these convex formulations, we further develop an exact algorithm to fit continuous univariate functions. Computational results for benchmark instances from the literature demonstrate the superiority of the proposed convex models compared with state-of-the-art nonconvex models.}

  abstract = {The concepts of positive span and positive basis are important in derivative-free optimization. In fact, a well-known result is that if the gradient of a continuously differentiable objective function on {$\mathbb{R}n$}Rn{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}n is nonzero at a point, then one of the vectors in any positive basis (or any positive spanning set) of {$\mathbb{R}n$}Rn{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}n is a descent direction for the objective function from that point. This article summarizes the basic results and explores additional properties of positive spanning sets, positively independent sets and positive bases that are potentially useful in the design of derivative-free optimization algorithms. In particular, it provides construction procedures for these special sets of vectors that were not previously mentioned in the literature. It also proves that invertible linear transformations preserve positive independence and the positive spanning property. Moreover, this article introduces the notion of linear equivalence between positive spanning sets and between positively independent sets to simplify the analysis of their structures. Linear equivalence turns out to be a generalization of the concept of structural equivalence between positive bases that was introduced by Coope and Price (SIAM J Optim 11:859--869, 2001). Furthermore, this article clarifies which properties of linearly independent sets, spanning sets and ordinary bases carry over to positively independent sets, positive spanning sets, and positive bases. For example, a linearly independent set can always be extended to a basis of a linear space but a positively independent set cannot always be extended to a positive basis. Also, the maximum size of a linearly independent set in {$Rn$}RnR{\textasciicircum}n is n but there is no limit to the size of a positively independent set in {$\mathbb{R}n$}Rn{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}n when {$n\geq$}3n{$\geq$}3n {\textbackslash}ge 3. Whenever possible, the results are proved for the more general case of frames of convex cones instead of focusing only on positive bases of linear spaces. In addition, this article discusses some algorithms for determining whether a given set of vectors is positively independent or whether it positively spans a linear subspace of {$\mathbb{R}n$}Rn{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}n. Finally, it provides an algorithm for extending any finite set of vectors to a positive spanning set of {$\mathbb{R}n$}Rn{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}n using only a relatively small number of additional vectors.},

  abstract = {This book aims at developing a thorough understanding of the most general theory for interior-point methods, a class of algorithms for convex optimization problems. The study of these algorithms has dominated the continuous optimization literature for nearly 15 years, beginning with the paper by Karmarkar [10]. In that time, the theory has matured tremendously, perhaps most notably due to the path-breaking, broadly encompassing, and enormously influential work of Nesterov and Nemirovskii [15]. Much of the literature on the general theory of interior-point methods is difficult to understand, even for specialists. My hope is that this book will make the most general theory accessible to a wide audience---especially Ph.D. students, the next generation of optimizers. The book might be used for graduate courses in optimization, both in mathematics and engineering departments. Moreover, it is self-contained and thus appropriate for individual study by students as well as by seasoned researchers who wish to better assimilate the most general interior-point method theory. This book grew out of my lecture notes for the Ph.D. course on interior-point methods at Cornell University. The impetus for writing the book came from an invitation to give the annual lecture series at the Center for Operations Research and Econometrics (CORE) at Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, in fall, 1996. The book is being published by CORE as well as in the SIAM-MPS series. The writing of this book has been a particularly satisfying experience. It has brought into sharp focus the beauty and coherence of the interior-point method theory as developed and influenced through the efforts of many researchers. I hope those researchers will not be offended by my choice to cite few references (and I hope they largely agree that the ones I have cited are the ones that should be cited, given the material covered herein). The reader can look to recent articles and books for extensive bibliographies (cf. [21], [22], [24], [25]); a great place to stay up to date is Interior-Point Methods Online (http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/otc/InteriorPoint/). In citing few references, my intent is not to give the impression of research originality. Indeed, most of the results in this monograph are undoubtedly embedded somewhere in [15], [16], and [17] (which in turn were influenced by other works). My only claim to originality is in presenting a simplifying perspective.},

  abstract = {Constraint programming is a powerful paradigm for solving combinatorial search problems that draws on a wide range of techniques from artificial intelligence, computer science, databases, programming languages, and operations research. Constraint programming is currently applied with success to many domains, such as scheduling, planning, vehicle routing, configuration, networks, and bioinformatics.The aim of this handbook is to capture the full breadth and depth of the constraint programming field and to be encyclopedic in its scope and coverage. While there are several excellent books on constraint programming, such books necessarily focus on the main notions and techniques and cannot cover also extensions, applications, and languages. The handbook gives a reasonably complete coverage of all these lines of work, based on constraint programming, so that a reader can have a rather precise idea of the whole field and its potential. Of course each line of work is dealt with in a survey-like style, where some details may be neglected in favor of coverage. However, the extensive bibliography of each chapter will help the interested readers to find suitable sources for the missing details. Each chapter of the handbook is intended to be a self-contained survey of a topic, and is written by one or more authors who are leading researchers in the area.The intended audience of the handbook is researchers, graduate students, higher-year undergraduates and practitioners who wish to learn about the state-of-the-art in constraint programming. No prior knowledge about the field is necessary to be able to read the chapters and gather useful knowledge. Researchers from other fields should find in this handbook an effective way to learn about constraint programming and to possibly use some of the constraint programming concepts and techniques in their work, thus providing a means for a fruitful cross-fertilization among different research areas.The handbook is organized in two parts. The first part covers the basic foundations of constraint programming, including the history, the notion of constraint propagation, basic search methods, global constraints, tractability and computational complexity, and important issues in modeling a problem as a constraint problem. The second part covers constraint languages and solver, several useful extensions to the basic framework (such as interval constraints, structured domains, and distributed CSPs), and successful application areas for constraint programming.- Covers the whole field of constraint programming- Survey-style chapters- Five chapters on applications},

Recently it has been shown that the convex hull of SO(d) can be described in terms of linear matrix inequalities. This allows us to devise new semidefinite programming-based reformulations and relaxations of problems involving rotation matrices. In this paper we illustrate the use of these techniques for two different types of optimization problems over SO(d). The first type of problem arises in jointly estimating the attitude and spin-rate of a spin-stabilized satellite. We show how to exactly reformulate such problems as semidefinite programs. The second type of problem arises when estimating the orientations of a network of objects (such as cameras, satellites or molecules) from noisy relative orientation measurements. For this class of problems we formulate new semidefinite relaxations that are tighter than those existing in the literature, and show that they are exact when the underlying graph is a tree.}

A linear programming relaxation is derived for the problem based on a Reformulation Linearization Technique (RLT), which generates nonlinear (polynomial) implied constraints to be included in the original problem, and subsequently linearizes the resulting problem by defining new variables, one for each distinct polynomial term. This construct is then used to obtain lower bounds in the context of a proposed branch and bound scheme, which is proven to converge to a global optimal solution. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm.},

Many such problems can be formulated as the minimization of functionals defined over a class of admissible domains. Shape optimization is quite indispensable in the design and construction of industrial structures. For example, aircraft and spacecraft have to satisfy, at the same time, very strict criteria on mechanical performance while weighing as little as possible. The shape optimization problem for such a structure consists in finding a geometry of the structure which minimizes a given functional (e. g. such as the weight of the structure) and yet simultaneously satisfies specific constraints (like thickness, strain energy, or displacement bounds). The geometry of the structure can be considered as a given domain in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. The domain is an open, bounded set whose topology is given, e. g. it may be simply or doubly connected. The boundary is smooth or piecewise smooth, so boundary value problems that are defined in the domain and associated with the classical partial differential equations of mathematical physics are well posed. In general the cost functional takes the form of an integral over the domain or its boundary where the integrand depends smoothly on the solution of a boundary value problem.},

Applications of the modified method to decomposition in convex programming and monotone variational inequalities are discussed.}

Some general results are presented, techniques of approximating the separable problem by linear programming problem, and dynamic programming are also studied. Convex separable programs subject to inequality/ equality constraint(s) and bounds on variables are also studied and convergent iterative algorithms of polynomial complexity are proposed.~ As an application, these algorithms are used in the implementation of stochastic quasigradient methods to some separable stochastic programs. The problems of numerical approximation of tabulated functions and numerical solution of overdetermined systems of linear algebraic equations and some systems of nonlinear equations are solved by separable convex unconstrained minimization problems. Some properties of the Knapsack polytope are also studied. This second edition includes a substantial amount of new and revised content. Three new chapters, 15-17, are included. Chapters 15-16 are devoted to the further analysis of the Knapsack problem. Chapter 17 is focused on the analysis of a nonlinear transportation problem. Three new Appendices (E-G) are also added to this edition and present technical details that help round out the coverage. ~ Optimization problems and methods for solving the problems considered are interesting not only from the viewpoint of optimization theory, optimization methods and their applications, but also from the viewpoint of other fields of science, especially the artificial intelligence and machine learning fields within computer science. This book is intended for the researcher, practitioner, or engineer who is interested in the detailed treatment of separable programming and wants to take advantage of the latest theoretical and~algorithmic results. It~may also be~used as a textbook for a special topics course or as a~supplementary textbook for graduate courses~on nonlinear and convex optimization.},

Our algorithm is very robust, placing no requirements on the problem data such as positive definiteness of the objective function or linear independence of the constraint functions. It can be configured to be division-free once an initial matrix factorization is carried out, making it suitable for real-time applications in embedded systems. In addition, our technique is the first operator splitting method for quadratic programs able to reliably detect primal and dual infeasible problems from the algorithm iterates. The method also supports factorization caching and warm starting, making it particularly efficient when solving parametrized problems arising in finance, control, and machine learning. Our open-source C implementation OSQP has a small footprint, is library-free, and has been extensively tested on many problem instances from a wide variety of application areas. It is typically ten times faster than competing interior-point methods, and sometimes much more when factorization caching or warm start is used. OSQP has already shown a large impact with tens of thousands of users both in academia and in large corporations.},

The classic problem of the travelling salesman is used as a common thread to illustrate all the techniques discussed.

The book features a wealth of illustrations that allow the concepts to be understood at a glance. The book approaches the main metaheuristics from a new angle, deconstructing them into a few key concepts presented in separate chapters: construction, improvement, decomposition, randomization and learning methods. Each metaheuristic can then be presented in simplified form as a combination of these concepts. This approach avoids giving the impression that metaheuristics is a non-formal discipline, a kind of cloud sculpture. Moreover, it provides concrete applications of the travelling salesman problem, which illustrate in just a few lines of code how to design a new heuristic and remove all ambiguities left by a general framework. Two chapters reviewing the basics of combinatorial optimization and complexity theory make the book self-contained. As such, even readers with a very limited background in the field will be able to follow all the content.},

Our heuristic is based on a variation of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), an algorithm for solving convex optimisation problems. We discuss the favourable computational aspects of our algorithm, which allow it to run quickly even on very modest computational platforms such as embedded processors. We give several examples for which an approximate solution should be found very quickly, such as management of a hybrid-electric vehicle drivetrain and control of switched-mode power converters. Our numerical experiments suggest that our method is very effective in finding a feasible point with small objective value; indeed, we see that in many cases, it finds the global solution.}

  abstract = {A new approach for optimization or hedging of a portfolio of finance instruments to reduce the risks of high losses is suggested and tested with several applications. As a measure of risk, Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is used. For several important cases, CVaR coincides with the expected shortfall (expected loss exceeding Values-at-Risk). However, generally, CVaR and the expected shortfall are different risk measures. CVaR is a coh erent risk measure both for continuous and discrete distributions. CVaR is a more consistent measure of risk than VaR. Portfolios with low CVaR also have low VaR because CVaR is greater than VaR. The approach is based on a new representation of the performance function, which allows simultaneous calculation of VaR and minimization of CVaR. It can be used in conjunction with analytical or scenario based optimization algorithms If the number of scenarios is fixed, the problem is reduced to a Linear Programming or Nonsmooth Optimization Problem. These techniques allow optimizing portfolios with large numbers of instruments. The approach is tested with two examples: (1) portfolio optimization and comparison with the Minimum Variance approach; (2) hedging of a portfolio of options. The suggested methodology can be used for optimizing of portfolios by investment companies, brokerage firms, mutual funds, and any businesses that evaluate risks. Although the approach is used for portfolio analysis, it is very general and can be applied to any financial or non-financial problems involving optimization of percentiles.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the semidefinite programming SDP problem, i.e., the optimization problem of a linear function of a symmetric matrix subject to linear equality constraints and the additional condition that the matrix be positive semidefinite. First the classical cone duality is reviewed as it is specialized to SDP is reviewed. Next an interior point algorithm is presented that converges to the optimal solution in polynomial time. The approach is a direct extension of Ye's projective method for linear programming. It is also argued that many known interior point methods for linear programs can be transformed in a mechanical way to algorithms for SDP with proofs of convergence and polynomial time complexity carrying over in a similar fashion. Finally, the significance of these results is studied in a variety of combinatorial optimization problems including the general 0-1 integer programs, the maximum clique and maximum stable set problems in perfect graphs, the maximum k-partite subgraph problem in graphs, and various graph partitioning and cut problems. As a result, barrier oracles are presented for certain combinatorial optimization problems (in particular, clique and stable set problem for perfect graphs) whose linear programming formulation requires exponentially many inequalities. Existence of such barrier oracles refutes the commonly believed notion that to solve a combinatorial optimization problem with interior point methods, its linear programming formulation is eeded explicitly.}

This book illustrates how the quantitative optimization of 21st century supply chains should be crafted and executed. . . . Vandeput is at the forefront of a new and better way of doing supply chains, and thanks to a richly illustrated book, where every single situation gets its own illustrating code snippet, so could you.--Joannes Vermorel, CEO, Lokad~Inventory Optimization argues that mathematical inventory models can only take us so far with supply chain management. In order to optimize inventory policies, we have to use probabilistic simulations. The book explains how to implement these models and simulations step-by-step, starting from simple deterministic ones to complex multi-echelon optimization.~The first two parts of the book discuss classical mathematical models, their limitations, and assumptions, and a quick but effective introduction to Python is provided. Part 3 contains more advanced models that will allow you to optimize your profits, estimate your lost sales and use advanced demand distributions. It also provides an explanation of how you can optimize a multi-echelon supply chain based on a simple yet powerful framework. Part 4 discusses inventory optimization thanks to simulations under custom discrete demand probability functions.~Inventory managers, demand planners, supply planners, and academics interested in gaining cost-effective solutions will benefit from the "do-it-yourself" examples and Python programs included in each chapter.},

A unified treatment of superlinear convergence, finite termination, and detection of infeasible problems is presented. Issues relevant to practical implementation are also discussed, including sparse linear algebra and a complete specification of Mehrotra's predictor-corrector algorithm.

  abstract = {Optimality and stability are two important notions in applied mathematics. This book is a study of these notions and their relationship in linear and convex parametric programming models. It begins with a survey of basic optimality conditions in nonlinear programming. Then new results in convex programming, using LFS functions, for single-objective, multi-objective, differentiable and non-smooth programs are introduced. Parametric programming models are studied using basic tools of point-to-set topology. Stability of the models is introduced, essentially, as continuity of the feasible set of decision variables under continuous perturbations of the parameters. Perturbations that preserve this continuity are regions of stability. It is shown how these regions can be identified. The main results on stability are characterizations of locally and globally optimal parameters for stable and also for unstable perturbations. The results are straightened for linear models and bi-level programs. Some of the results are extended to abstract spaces after considering parameters as `controls'. Illustrations from diverse fields, such as data envelopment analysis, management, von Stackelberg games of market economy, and navigation problems are given and several case studies are solved by finding optimal parameters. The book has been written in an analytic spirit. Many results appear here for the first time in book form.  Audience: The book is written at the level of a first-year graduate course in optimization for students with varied backgrounds interested in modeling of real-life problems. It is expected that the reader has been exposed to a prior elementary course in optimization, such as linear or non-linear programming. The last section of the book requires some knowledge of functional analysis.},
