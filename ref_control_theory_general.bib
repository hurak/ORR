  abstract = {This textbook covers the mathematics needed to model, analyze, and design feedback systems. Now more user-friendly than ever, this revised and expanded edition of Feedback Systems is a one-volume resource for students and researchers in mathematics and engineering. It has applications across a range of disciplines that utilize feedback in physical, biological, information, and economic systems. Karl {\AA}str{\"o}m and Richard Murray use techniques from physics, computer science, and operations research to introduce control-oriented modeling. They begin with state space tools for analysis and design, including stability of solutions, Lyapunov functions, reachability, state feedback observability, and estimators. The matrix exponential plays a central role in the analysis of linear control systems, allowing a concise development of many of the key concepts for this class of models. {\AA}str{\"o}m and Murray then develop and explain tools in the frequency domain, including transfer functions, Nyquist analysis, PID control, frequency domain design, and robustness.     Features a new chapter on design principles and tools, illustrating the types of problems that can be solved using feedback     Includes a new chapter on fundamental limits and new material on the Routh-Hurwitz criterion and root locus plots     Provides exercises at the end of every chapter     Comes with an electronic solutions manual     An ideal textbook for undergraduate and graduate students     Indispensable for researchers seeking a self-contained resource on control theory.},

  abstract = {System and Control theory is one of the most exciting areas of contemporary engineering mathematics. From the analysis of Watt's steam engine governor - which enabled the Industrial Revolution - to the design of controllers for consumer items, chemical plants and modern aircraft, the area has always drawn from a broad range of tools. It has provided many challenges and possibilities for interaction between engineering and established areas of 'pure' and 'applied' mathematics. This impressive volume collects a discussion of more than fifty open problems which touch upon a variety of subfields, including: chaotic observers, nonlinear local controlability, discrete event and hybrid systems, neural network learning, matrix inequalities, Lyapunov exponents, and many other issues. Proposed and explained by leading researchers, they are offered with the intention of generating further work, as well as inspiration for many other similar problems which may naturally arise from them. With extensive references, this book will be a useful reference source - as well as an excellent addendum to the textbooks in the area.},

The book combines an exposition of linear control theory and the corresponding modern relevant computational techniques such as orthogonal polynomials, Pad{\'e} approximation, numerical linear algebra, and some topics on nonlinear differential equations. It can be considered as an introduction to control theory for numerical analysts looking for a wide area of applications and as an introduction to recent numerical methods for control specialists.

In this highly regarded text for students and control engineers, the authors examine all of these advances, providing an in-depth examination of modern optimal and robust control.After a brief introductory chapter, the text proceeds to examinations of multivariable frequency response design, signals and systems, and linear fractional transformations and their role in control systems. Subsequent chapters develop the control system synthesis theory, beginning with a concise treatment of the linear quadratic Gaussian problem and advancing to full-information H-infinity~controller synthesis, the H-infinity filter, and the H-infinity~generalized regulator problem. Concluding chapters examine model reduction by truncation, optimal model reduction, and the four-block problem. The text concludes with a pair of design case studies and helpful appendices. This treatment requires familiarity with linear algebra, matrix theory, linear differential equations, classical control theory, and linear systems theory.},
