  abstract = {Standard necessary conditions for optimal control problems with pathwise state constraints supply no useful information about minimizers in a number of cases of interest, e.g., when the left endpoint of state trajectories is fixed at x0  and x0  lies in the boundary of the state constraint set; in these cases a nonzero, but nevertheless trivial, set of multipliers exists. We give conditions for the existence of nontrivial multipliers. A feature of these conditions is that they allow nonconvex velocity sets and measurably time-dependent data. The proof techniques are based on refined estimates of the distance of a given state trajectory from the set of state trajectories satisfying the state constraint, originating in the dynamic programming literature.}

We unify, subsume, and significantly extend most of the results on this subject, notably in the three special cases that comprise the bulk of the literature: calculus of variations, differential-algebraic systems, and mixed constraints specified by equalities and inequalities. Our approach also provides a new and unified calibrated formulation of the appropriate constraint qualifications, and shows how to extend them to nonsmooth data. Other features include a very weak hypothesis concerning the type of local minimum, nonrestrictive hypotheses on the data, and stronger conclusions, notably as regards the maximum (or Weierstrass) condition. The necessary conditions are stratified, in the sense that they are asserted on precisely the domain upon which the hypotheses (and the optimality) are assumed to hold. This leads to local, intermediate, and global versions of the necessary conditions, according to how the hypotheses are formulated.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of quadratic optimal control with state variables unilateral constraints, for linear time-invariant systems. The necessary conditions are formulated as a linear invariant system with complementary slackness conditions. Some structural properties of this system are examined. Then it is shown that the problem can benefit from the higher order Moreau's sweeping process, that is, a specific distributional differential inclusion, and from ten Dam's geometric theory [A.A. ten Dam, K.F. Dwarshuis, J.C. Willems, The contact problem for linear continuous-time dynamical systems: A geometric approach, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control 42 (4) (1997) 458{\textendash}472; A.A. ten Dam, Unilaterally Constrained Dynamical Systems, Ph.D. Thesis, Rijsuniversiteit Groningen, NL, available at http://irs.ub.rug.nl/ppn/159407869, 1997] for partitioning of the admissible domain boundary (in particular for the case of multivariable systems). In fact, the first step may be also seen as follows: does the higher order Moreau's sweeping process (developed in Acary et~al. [V. Acary, B. Brogliato, D. Goeleven, Higher order Moreau's sweeping process: Mathematical formulation and numerical simulation, Math. Programm.

The knowledge of the qualitative behaviour of optimal trajectories at junction times is improved with the approach, which also paves the way towards efficient time-stepping numerical algorithms to solve the optimal control boundary value problem.},

The calculus of variations was developed further in the 18th century by Euler and Lagrange and in the 19th century by Legendre, Jacobi, Hamilton, and Weierstrass. In the early 20th century, Bolza and Bliss put the final touches of rigor on the subject. In 1957, Bellman gave a new view of Hamilton-Jacobi theory which he called dynamic programming, essentially a nonlinear feedback control scheme. McShane (1939) and Pontryagin (1962) extended the calculus of variations to handle control variable inequality constraints, the latter enunciating his elegant maximum principle. The truly enabling element for use of optimal control theory was the digital computer, which became available commercially in the 1950s. In the 1980s research began, and continues today, on making optimal feedback logic more robust to variations in the plant and disturbance models; one element of this research is worst-case and H-infinity control, which developed out of differential game theory.}

Two discretization methods are discussed that transcribe optimal control problems into nonlinear programming problems for which SQP-methods provide efficient solution methods. It is shown that SQP-methods can be used also for a check of second-order sufficient conditions and for a postoptimal calculation of adjoint variables. In addition, SQP-methods lead to a robust computation of sensitivity differentials of optimal solutions with respect to perturbation parameters. Numerical sensitivity analysis is the basis for real-time control approximations of perturbed solutions which are obtained by evaluating a first-order Taylor expansion with respect to the parameter. The proposed numerical methods are illustrated by the optimal control of a low-thrust satellite transfer to geosynchronous orbit and a complex control problem from aquanautics. The examples illustrate the robustness, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed numerical algorithms.},

The application of the maximum principle leads to parameterize the optimal control and the multipliers associated with the state constraints with the state and the costate and leads to describe a multipoint boundary value problem, which is solved by multiple shooting. This indirect method is the numerical implementation of the maximum principle with state constraints and it is initialized by the direct method, both to determine the optimal structure and to obtain a satisfying initial guess. The solutions of the boundary value problems we define give extremals, which satisfy necessary conditions of optimality with at most 2 boundary arcs. Note that the aircraft dynamics has a singular perturbation but no reduction is performed.},

The addition of inequality constraints leads to nonlinear control behavior. Certain propulsion system parameters are characterized as state variables as a convenient means for providing adaptive behavior in respect to in-flight changes in propulsion system performance. An application is given to an intercept problem sufficiently simple to allow analytical solution, and some numerical results comparing optimal and approximately optimal guidance in their effects on flight performance are presented.

  abstract = {The generalized Legendre{\textendash}Clebsch higher order tests for optimality of singular arcs in optimal control problems depend upon the orders of the arcs involved. To date three distinct definitions of order have been given but many authors do not distinguish among them. The features of each definition are discussed with special reference to the applicability of the higher order tests and of the conditions at junctions between singular and nonsingular arcs; only in terms of one of the definitions are the junction conditions generally valid. An illustrative example is presented.}

  abstract = {The calculus of variations is used to find functions that optimize quantities expressed in terms of integrals. Optimal control theory seeks to find functions that minimize cost integrals for systems described by differential equations. This book is an introduction to both the classical theory of the calculus of variations and the more modern developments of optimal control theory from the perspective of an applied mathematician. It focuses on understanding concepts and how to apply them. The range of potential applications is broad: the calculus of variations and optimal control theory have been widely used in numerous ways in biology, criminology, economics, engineering, finance, management science, and physics. Applications described in this book include cancer chemotherapy, navigational control, and renewable resource harvesting. The prerequisites for the book are modest: the standard calculus sequence, a first course on ordinary differential equations, and some facility with the use of mathematical software. It is suitable for an undergraduate or beginning graduate course, or for self study. It provides excellent preparation for more advanced books and courses on the calculus of variations and optimal control theory.},

Both first-variation methods and second-variation methods are reviewed.Concerning first-variation methods, a direct approach and an indirect approach are given. They both cause a reduction of the integral at each iteration.Concerning second-variation methods, two possibilities are explored: (i) reduction of the integral, and (ii) reduction of the performance index. In case (i), two viewpoints are employed: (a) minimization of the sum of the first variation and the second variation, and (b) minimization of the first variation for a given second variation. In case (ii), two viewpoints are employed : (a) quasi-linearization of the Euler equation, and (b) descent process on the performance index.}

The authors develop theory for a control problem with ordinary differential equations subject to boundary conditions of equality and inequality type, and for mixed state-control constraints of equality type. The book has several distinctive features: necessary and sufficient conditions are given in the form of no-gap conditions; the theory covers broken extremals where the control has finitely many points of discontinuity; and a number of numerical examples in various areas of application are fully solved. This book will be of interest to academic researchers in calculus of variations and optimal control. It will also be a useful resource to researchers and engineers who use applications of optimal control in areas such as mechanics, mechatronics, physics, economics, or chemical, electrical and biological engineering.},

  abstract = {This paper provides necessary conditions  of optimality for optimal control problems, in which the pathwise constraints comprise both ``pure'' constraints on the state variable and ``mixed'' constraints on control and state variables. The proofs are along the lines of earlier analysis for mixed constraint problems, according to which Clarke's theory of ``stratified'' necessary conditions is applied to a modified optimal control problem resulting from absorbing the mixed constraint into the dynamics; the difference here is that necessary conditions which now take into account the presence of pure state constraints are applied to the modified problem. Necessary conditions are given for a rather general formulation of the problem containing both forms of the constraints, and then these are specialized to problems having special structure. While combined pure state and mixed control/state problems have been previously treated in the literature, the necessary conditions in this paper are proved under less restrictive hypotheses and for novel formulations of the constraints.}
